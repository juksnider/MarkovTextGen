The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism \'96 that of Feuerbach included \'96 is that the thing , reality , sensuousness , is conceived only in the form of the\'a0object or of contemplation , but not as\'a0sensuous human activity , practice , not subjectively  .  Hence , in contradistinction to materialism , the\'a0active\'a0side was developed abstractly by idealism \'96 which , of course , does not know real , sensuous activity as such  . \
Feuerbach wants sensuous objects , really distinct from the thought objects , but he does not conceive human activity itself as\'a0objective\'a0activity  .  Hence , in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/feuerbach/works/essence/index.htm"}}{\fldrslt The Essence of Christianity}} , he regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude , while practice is conceived and fixed only in its dirty-judaical manifestation  .  Hence he does not grasp the significance of \'93revolutionary\'94 , of \'93practical-critical\'94 , activity  . \
\
II\
The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question  .  Man must prove the truth \'97 i  . e  .  the reality and power , the this-sidedness of his thinking in practice  .  The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking that is isolated from practice is a purely\'a0scholastic\'a0question  . \
III\
The materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances and upbringing forgets that circumstances are changed by men and that it is essential to educate the educator himself  .  This doctrine must , therefore , divide society into two parts , one of which is superior to society  . \
The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-changing can be conceived and rationally understood only as\'a0revolutionary practice  . \
\
IV\
Feuerbach starts out from the fact of religious self-alienation , of the duplication of the world into a religious world and a secular one  .  His work consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis  . \
But that the secular basis detaches itself from itself and establishes itself as an independent realm in the clouds can only be explained by the cleavages and self-contradictions within this secular basis  .  The latter must , therefore , in itself be both understood in its contradiction and revolutionized in practice  .  Thus , for instance , after the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family , the former must then itself be destroyed in theory and in practice  . \
\
V\
Feuerbach , not satisfied with abstract thinking , wants contemplation ; but he does not conceive sensuousness as practical , human-sensuous activity  . \
\
VI\
Feuerbach resolves the religious essence into the human essence  .  But the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual  . \
In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations  . \
Feuerbach , who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence , is consequently compelled  :\
	1  . 	To abstract from the historical process and to fix the religious sentiment as something by itself and to presuppose an abstract \'96 isolated \'96 human individual  . \
	2  . 	Essence , therefore , can be comprehended only as \'93genus\'94 , as an internal , dumb generality which naturally unites the many individuals  . \
\
VII\
Feuerbach , consequently , does not see that the \'93religious sentiment\'94 is itself a social product , and that the abstract individual whom he analyses belongs to a particular form of society  . \
\
VIII\
All social life is essentially practical  .  All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice  . \
\
IX\
The highest point reached by contemplative materialism , that is , materialism which does not comprehend sensuousness as practical activity , is contemplation of single individuals and of civil society  . \
\
X\
The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society ; the standpoint of the new is human society , or social humanity  . \
\
XI\
The philosophers have only interpreted the world , in various ways ; the point is to change it  . \
Hitherto men have constantly made up for themselves false conceptions about themselves , about what they are and what they ought to be  .  They have arranged their relationships according to their ideas of God , of normal man , etc  .  The phantoms of their brains have got out of their hands  .  They , the creators , have bowed down before their creations  .  Let us liberate them from the chimeras , the ideas , dogmas , imaginary beings under the yoke of which they are pining away  .  Let us revolt against the rule of thoughts  .  Let us teach men , says one , to exchange these imaginations for thoughts which correspond to the essence of man ; says the second , to take up a critical attitude to them ; says the third , to knock them out of their heads ; and -- existing reality will collapse  . \
These innocent and childlike fancies are the kernel of the modern Young-Hegelian philosophy , which not only is received by the German public with horror and awe , but is announced by our philosophic heroes with the solemn consciousness of its cataclysmic dangerousness and criminal ruthlessness  .  The first volume of the present publication has the aim of uncloaking these sheep , who take themselves and are taken for wolves ; of showing how their bleating merely imitates in a philosophic form the conceptions of the German middle class ; how the boasting of these philosophic commentators only mirrors the wretchedness of the real conditions in Germany  .  It is its aim to debunk and discredit the philosophic struggle with the shadows of reality , which appeals to the dreamy and muddled German nation  . \
Once upon a time a valiant fellow had the idea that men were drowned in water only because they were possessed with the idea of gravity  .  If they were to knock this notion out of their heads , say by stating it to be a superstition , a religious concept , they would be sublimely proof against any danger from water  .  His whole life long he fought against the illusion of gravity , of whose harmful results all statistics brought him new and manifold evidence  .  This valiant fellow was the type of the new revolutionary philosophers in Germany  . \

The Illusions of German Ideology\
As we hear from German ideologists , Germany has in the last few years gone through an unparalleled revolution  .  The decomposition of the Hegelian philosophy , which began with Strauss , has developed into a universal ferment into which all the \'93powers of the past\'94 are swept  .  In the general chaos mighty empires have arisen only to meet with immediate doom , heroes have emerged momentarily only to be hurled back into obscurity by bolder and stronger rivals  .  It was a revolution beside which the French Revolution was child\'92s play , a world struggle beside which the struggles of the Diadochi  [ successors of Alexander the Great ] appear insignificant  .  Principles ousted one another , heroes of the mind overthrew each other with unheard-of rapidity , and in the three years 1842-45 more of the past was swept away in Germany than at other times in three centuries  . \
All this is supposed to have taken place in the realm of pure thought  . \
Certainly it is an interesting event we are dealing with  : the putrescence of the absolute spirit  .  When the last spark of its life had failed , the various components of this\'a0caput mortuum\'a0began to decompose , entered into new combinations and formed new substances  .  The industrialists of philosophy , who till then had lived on the exploitation of the absolute spirit , now seized upon the new combinations  .  Each with all possible zeal set about retailing his apportioned share  .  This naturally gave rise to competition , which , to start with , was carried on in moderately staid bourgeois fashion  .  Later when the German market was glutted , and the commodity in spite of all efforts found no response in the world market , the business was spoiled in the usual German manner by fabricated and fictitious production , deterioration in quality , adulteration of the raw materials , falsification of labels , fictitious purchases , bill-jobbing and a credit system devoid of any real basis  .  The competition turned into a bitter struggle , which is now being extolled and interpreted to us as a revolution of world significance , the begetter of the most prodigious results and achievements  . \
If we wish to rate at its true value this philosophic charlatanry , which awakens even in the breast of the honest German citizen a glow of national pride , if we wish to bring out clearly the pettiness , the parochial narrowness of this whole\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/y/o.htm#young-hegelians"}}{\fldrslt Young-Hegelian}}\'a0movement and in particular the tragicomic contrast between the illusions of these heroes about their achievements and the actual achievements themselves , we must look at the whole spectacle from a standpoint beyond the frontiers of Germany  . \
 [ In the first version of the clean copy there follows a passage , which is crossed out  : ] |p  .  21|\
We preface therefore the specific criticism of individual representatives of this movement with a few general observations , elucidating the ideological premises common to all of them  .  These remarks will suffice to indicate the standpoint of our criticism insofar as it is required for the understanding and the motivation of the subsequent individual criticisms  .  We oppose these remarks |p  .  3| to\'a0Feuerbach\'a0in particular because he is the only one who has at least made some progress and whose works can be examined\'a0de bonne foi  . \
1  .  Ideology in General , and Especially German Philosophy\
A  . \'a0We know only a single science , the science of history  .  One can look at history from two sides and divide it into the history of nature and the history of men  .  The two sides are , however , inseparable ; the history of nature and the history of men are dependent on each other so long as men exist  .  The history of nature , called natural science , does not concern us here ; but we will have to examine the history of men , since almost the whole ideology amounts either to a distorted conception of this history or to a complete abstraction from it  .  Ideology is itself only one of the aspects of this history  . \
 [ There follows a passage dealing with the premises of the materialist conception of history  .  It is not crossed out and in this volume it is reproduced as Section 2 ; see pp  .  31-32 ]\
Ideology in General , German Ideology in Particular\
German criticism has , right up to its latest efforts , never quitted the realm of philosophy  .  Far from examining its general philosophic premises , the whole body of its inquiries has actually sprung from the soil of a definite philosophical system , that of Hegel  .  Not only in their answers but in their very questions there was a mystification  .  This dependence on Hegel is the reason why not one of these modern critics has even attempted a comprehensive criticism of the Hegelian system , however much each professes to have advanced beyond Hegel  .  Their polemics against Hegel and against one another are confined to this \'96 each extracts one side of the Hegelian system and turns this against the whole system as well as against the sides extracted by the others  .  To begin with they extracted pure unfalsified Hegelian categories such as \'93substance\'94 and \'93self-consciousness ,\'94 later they desecrated these categories with more secular names such as species \'93the Unique ,\'94 \'93Man ,\'94 etc  . \
The entire body of German philosophical criticism from Strauss to Stirner is confined to criticism of religious conceptions  . \'a0 [ The following passage is crossed out in the manuscript  : ] claiming to be the absolute redeemer of the world from all evil  .  Religion was continually regarded and treated as the arch-enemy , as the ultimate cause of all relations repugnant to these philosophers  . \'a0The critics started from real religion and actual theology  .  What religious consciousness and a religious conception really meant was determined variously as they went along  .  Their advance consisted in subsuming the allegedly dominant metaphysical , political , juridical , moral and other conceptions under the class of religious or theological conceptions ; and similarly in pronouncing political , juridical , moral consciousness as religious or theological , and the political , juridical , moral man \'96 \'93man\'94 in the last resort \'96 as religious  .  The dominance of religion was taken for granted  .  Gradually every dominant relationship was pronounced a religious relationship and transformed into a cult , a cult of law , a cult of the State , etc  .  On all sides it was only a question of dogmas and belief in dogmas  .  The world was sanctified to an ever-increasing extent till at last our venerable\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/s/t.htm#stirner-max"}}{\fldrslt Saint Max}}\'a0was able to canonise it\'a0en bloc\'a0and thus dispose of it once for all  . \
The Old Hegelians had comprehended everything as soon as it was reduced to an Hegelian logical category  .  The Young Hegelians criticised everything by attributing to it religious conceptions or by pronouncing it a theological matter  .  The Young Hegelians are in agreement with the Old Hegelians in their belief in the rule of religion , of concepts , of a universal principle in the existing world  .  Only , the one party attacks this dominion as usurpation , while the other extols it as legitimate  . \
Since the Young Hegelians consider conceptions , thoughts , ideas , in fact all the products of consciousness , to which they attribute an independent existence , as the real chains of men (  just as the Old Hegelians declared them the true bonds of human society  ) it is evident that the Young Hegelians have to fight only against these illusions of consciousness  .  Since , according to their fantasy , the relationships of men , all their doings , their chains and their limitations are products of their consciousness , the Young Hegelians logically put to men the moral postulate of exchanging their present consciousness for human , critical or egoistic consciousness , and thus of removing their limitations  .  This demand to change consciousness amounts to a demand to interpret reality in another way , i  . e  .  to recognise it by means of another interpretation  .  The Young-Hegelian ideologists , in spite of their allegedly \'93world-shattering  "   statements , are the staunchest conservatives  .  The most recent of them have found the correct expression for their activity when they declare they are only fighting against \'93phrases  . \'94 They forget , however , that to these phrases they themselves are only opposing other phrases , and that they are in no way combating the real existing world when they are merely combating the phrases of this world  .  The only results which this philosophic criticism could achieve were a few (  and at that thoroughly one-sided  ) elucidations of Christianity from the point of view of religious history ; all the rest of their assertions are only further embellishments of their claim to have furnished , in these unimportant elucidations , discoveries of universal importance  . \
It has not occurred to any one of these philosophers to inquire into the connection of German philosophy with German reality , the relation of their criticism to their own material surroundings  . \
\
\
First Premises of Materialist Method\
The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones , not dogmas , but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination  .  They are the real individuals , their activity and the material conditions under which they live , both those which they find already existing and those produced by their activity  .  These premises can thus be verified in a purely empirical way  . \
The first premise of all human history is , of course , the existence of living human individuals  .  Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature  .  Of course , we cannot here go either into the actual physical nature of man , or into the natural conditions in which man finds himself \'96 geological , hydrographical , climatic and so on  .  The writing of history must always set out from these natural bases and their modification in the course of history through the action of men  . \
Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness , by religion or anything else you like  .  They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence , a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation  .  By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life  . \
The way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce  .  This mode of production must not be considered simply as being the production of the physical existence of the individuals  .  Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals , a definite form of expressing their life , a definite mode of life on their part  .  As individuals express their life , so they are  .  What they are , therefore , coincides with their production , both with what they produce and with how they produce  .  The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production  . \
This production only makes its appearance with the increase of population  .  In its turn this presupposes the intercourse  [ Verkehr ] of individuals with one another  .  The form of this intercourse is again determined by production  . \
 [ 3  .  Production and Intercourse  . \uc0\u8232 Division of Labour and Forms of Property \'96 Tribal , Ancient , Feudal ]\
The relations of different nations among themselves depend upon the extent to which each has developed its productive forces , the division of labour and internal intercourse  .  This statement is generally recognised  .  But not only the relation of one nation to others , but also the whole internal structure of the nation itself depends on the stage of development reached by its production and its internal and external intercourse  .  How far the productive forces of a nation are developed is shown most manifestly by the degree to which the division of labour has been carried  .  Each new productive force , insofar as it is not merely a quantitative extension of productive forces already known (  for instance the bringing into cultivation of fresh land  ) , causes a further development of the division of labour  . \
The division of labour inside a nation leads at first to the separation of industrial and commercial from agricultural labour , and hence to the separation of town and country and to the conflict of their interests  .  Its further development leads to the separation of commercial from industrial labour  .  At the same time through the division of labour inside these various branches there develop various divisions among the individuals co-operating in definite kinds of labour  .  The relative position of these individual groups is determined by the methods employed in agriculture , industry and commerce (  patriarchalism , slavery , estates , classes  )  .  These same conditions are to be seen (  given a more developed intercourse  ) in the relations of different nations to one another  . \
The various stages of development in the division of labour are just so many different forms of ownership , i  . e  .  the existing stage in the division of labour determines also the relations of individuals to one another with reference to the material , instrument , and product of labour  . \
The first form of ownership is tribal  [ Stammeigentum ] ownership  .  It corresponds to the undeveloped stage of production , at which a people lives by hunting and fishing , by the rearing of beasts or , in the highest stage , agriculture  .  In the latter case it presupposes a great mass of uncultivated stretches of land  .  The division of labour is at this stage still very elementary and is confined to a further extension of the natural division of labour existing in the family  .  The social structure is , therefore , limited to an extension of the family ; patriarchal family chieftains , below them the members of the tribe , finally slaves  .  The slavery latent in the family only develops gradually with the increase of population , the growth of wants , and with the extension of external relations , both of war and of barter  . \
The second form is the ancient communal and State ownership which proceeds especially from the union of several tribes into a city by agreement or by conquest , and which is still accompanied by slavery  .  Beside communal ownership we already find movable , and later also immovable , private property developing , but as an abnormal form subordinate to communal ownership  .  The citizens hold power over their labouring slaves only in their community , and on this account alone , therefore , they are bound to the form of communal ownership  .  It is the communal private property which compels the active citizens to remain in this spontaneously derived form of association over against their slaves  .  For this reason the whole structure of society based on this communal ownership , and with it the power of the people , decays in the same measure as , in particular , immovable private property evolves  .  The division of labour is already more developed  .  We already find the antagonism of town and country ; later the antagonism between those states which represent town interests and those which represent country interests , and inside the towns themselves the antagonism between industry and maritime commerce  .  The class relation between citizens and slaves is now completely developed  . \
With the development of private property , we find here for the first time the same conditions which we shall find again , only on a more extensive scale , with modern private property  .  On the one hand , the concentration of private property , which began very early in Rome (  as the Licinian agrarian law proves  ) and proceeded very rapidly from the time of the civil wars and especially under the Emperors ; on the other hand , coupled with this , the transformation of the plebeian small peasantry into a proletariat , which , however , owing to its intermediate position between propertied citizens and slaves , never achieved an independent development  . \
The third form of ownership is feudal or estate property  .  If antiquity started out from the town and its little territory , the Middle Ages started out from the country  .  This different starting-point was determined by the sparseness of the population at that time , which was scattered over a large area and which received no large increase from the conquerors  .  In contrast to Greece and Rome , feudal development at the outset , therefore , extends over a much wider territory , prepared by the Roman conquests and the spread of agriculture at first associated with it  .  The last centuries of the declining Roman Empire and its conquest by the barbarians destroyed a number of productive forces ; agriculture had declined , industry had decayed for want of a market , trade had died out or been violently suspended , the rural and urban population had decreased  .  From these conditions and the mode of organisation of the conquest determined by them , feudal property developed under the influence of the Germanic military constitution  .  Like tribal and communal ownership , it is based again on a community ; but the directly producing class standing over against it is not , as in the case of the ancient community , the slaves , but the enserfed small peasantry  .  As soon as feudalism is fully developed , there also arises antagonism to the towns  .  The hierarchical structure of land ownership , and the armed bodies of retainers associated with it , gave the nobility power over the serfs  .  This feudal organisation was , just as much as the ancient communal ownership , an association against a subjected producing class ; but the form of association and the relation to the direct producers were different because of the different conditions of production  . \
This feudal system of land ownership had its counterpart in the\'a0towns\'a0in the shape of corporative property , the feudal organisation of trades  .  Here property consisted chiefly in the labour of each individual person  .  The necessity for association against the organised robber-nobility , the need for communal covered markets in an age when the industrialist was at the same time a merchant , the growing competition of the escaped serfs swarming into the rising towns , the feudal structure of the whole country  : these combined to bring about the guilds  .  The gradually accumulated small capital of individual craftsmen and their stable numbers , as against the growing population , evolved the relation of journeyman and apprentice , which brought into being in the towns a hierarchy similar to that in the country  . \
Thus the chief form of property during the feudal epoch consisted on the one hand of landed property with serf labour chained to it , and on the other of the labour of the individual with small capital commanding the labour of journeymen  .  The organisation of both was determined by the restricted conditions of production \'96 the small-scale and primitive cultivation of the land , and the craft type of industry  .  There was little division of labour in the heyday of feudalism  .  Each country bore in itself the antithesis of town and country ; the division into estates was certainly strongly marked ; but apart from the differentiation of princes , nobility , clergy and peasants in the country , and masters , journeymen , apprentices and soon also the rabble of casual labourers in the towns , no division of importance took place  .  In agriculture it was rendered difficult by the strip-system , beside which the cottage industry of the peasants themselves emerged  .  In industry there was no division of labour at all in the individual trades themselves , and very little between them  .  The separation of industry and commerce was found already in existence in older towns ; in the newer it only developed later , when the towns entered into mutual relations  . \
The grouping of larger territories into feudal kingdoms was a necessity for the landed nobility as for the towns  .  The organisation of the ruling class , the nobility , had , therefore , everywhere a monarch at its head  . \
 [ 4  .  The Essence of the Materialist Conception of History  . \uc0\u8232 Social Being and Social Consciousness ]\
The fact is , therefore , that definite individuals who are productively active in a definite way enter into these definite social and political relations  .  Empirical observation must in each separate instance bring out empirically , and without any mystification and speculation , the connection of the social and political structure with production  .  The social structure and the State are continually evolving out of the life-process of definite individuals , but of individuals , not as they may appear in their own or other people\'92s imagination , but as they really are ; i  . e  .  as they operate , produce materially , and hence as they work under definite material limits , presuppositions and conditions independent of their will  . \
 [ The following passage is crossed out in the manuscript  : ] The ideas which these individuals form are ideas either about their relation to nature or about their mutual relations or about their own nature  .  It is evident that in all these cases their ideas are the conscious expression \'96 real or illusory \'96 of their real relations and activities , of their production , of their intercourse , of their social and political conduct  .  The opposite assumption is only possible if in addition to the spirit of the real , materially evolved individuals a separate spirit is presupposed  .  If the conscious expression of the real relations of these individuals is illusory , if in their imagination they turn reality upside-down , then this in its turn is the result of their limited material mode of activity and their limited social relations arising from it  . \
The production of ideas , of conceptions , of consciousness , is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men , the language of real life  .  Conceiving , thinking , the mental intercourse of men , appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behaviour  .  The same applies to mental production as expressed in the language of politics , laws , morality , religion , metaphysics , etc  .  , of a people  .  Men are the producers of their conceptions , ideas , etc  .  \'96 real , active men , as they are conditioned by a definite development of their productive forces and of the intercourse corresponding to these , up to its furthest forms  .  Consciousness can never be anything else than conscious existence , and the existence of men is their actual life-process  .  If in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a\'a0camera obscura , this phenomenon arises just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process  . \
In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth , here we ascend from earth to heaven  .  That is to say , we do not set out from what men say , imagine , conceive , nor from men as narrated , thought of , imagined , conceived , in order to arrive at men in the flesh  .  We set out from real , active men , and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process  .  The phantoms formed in the human brain are also , necessarily , sublimates of their material life-process , which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises  .  Morality , religion , metaphysics , all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness , thus no longer retain the semblance of independence  .  They have no history , no development ; but men , developing their material production and their material intercourse , alter , along with this their real existence , their thinking and the products of their thinking  .  Life is not determined by consciousness , but consciousness by life  .  In the first method of approach the starting-point is consciousness taken as the living individual ; in the second method , which conforms to real life , it is the real living individuals themselves , and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness  . \
This method of approach is not devoid of premises  .  It starts out from the real premises and does not abandon them for a moment  .  Its premises are men , not in any fantastic isolation and rigidity , but in their actual , empirically perceptible process of development under definite conditions  .  As soon as this active life-process is described , history ceases to be a collection of dead facts as it is with the empiricists (  themselves still abstract  ) , or an imagined activity of imagined subjects , as with the idealists  . \
Where speculation ends \'96 in real life \'96 there real , positive science begins  : the representation of the practical activity , of the practical process of development of men  .  Empty talk about consciousness ceases , and real knowledge has to take its place  .  When reality is depicted , philosophy as an independent branch of knowledge loses its medium of existence  .  At the best its place can only be taken by a summing-up of the most general results , abstractions which arise from the observation of the historical development of men  .  Viewed apart from real history , these abstractions have in themselves no value whatsoever  .  They can only serve to facilitate the arrangement of historical material , to indicate the sequence of its separate strata  .  But they by no means afford a recipe or schema , as does philosophy , for neatly trimming the epochs of history  .  On the contrary , our difficulties begin only when we set about the observation and the arrangement \'96 the real depiction \'96 of our historical material , whether of a past epoch or of the present  .  The removal of these difficulties is governed by premises which it is quite impossible to state here , but which only the study of the actual life-process and the activity of the individuals of each epoch will make evident  .  We shall select here some of these abstractions , which we use in contradistinction to the ideologists , and shall illustrate them by historical examples  . \
\
\
\
History  : Fundamental Conditions\
Since we are dealing with the Germans , who are devoid of premises , we must begin by stating the first premise of all human existence and , therefore , of all history , the premise , namely , that men must be in a position to live in order to be able to \'93make history  . \'94 But life involves before everything else eating and drinking , a habitation , clothing and many other things  .  The first historical act is thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs , the production of material life itself  .  And indeed this is an historical act , a fundamental condition of all history , which today , as thousands of years ago , must daily and hourly be fulfilled merely in order to sustain human life  .  Even when the sensuous world is reduced to a minimum , to a stick as with\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/b/a.htm#bauer-bruno"}}{\fldrslt Saint Bruno  [ Bauer ]}} , it presupposes the action of producing the stick  .  Therefore in any interpretation of history one has first of all to observe this fundamental fact in all its significance and all its implications and to accord it its due importance  .  It is well known that the Germans have never done this , and they have never , therefore , had an earthly basis for history and consequently never an historian  .  The French and the English , even if they have conceived the relation of this fact with so-called history only in an extremely one-sided fashion , particularly as long as they remained in the toils of political ideology , have nevertheless made the first attempts to give the writing of history a materialistic basis by being the first to write histories of civil society , of commerce and industry  . \
The second point is that the satisfaction of the first need (  the action of satisfying , and the instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired  ) leads to new needs ; and this production of new needs is the first historical act  .  Here we recognise immediately the spiritual ancestry of the great historical wisdom of the Germans who , when they run out of positive material and when they can serve up neither theological nor political nor literary rubbish , assert that this is not history at all , but the \'93prehistoric era  . \'94 They do not , however , enlighten us as to how we proceed from this nonsensical \'93prehistory\'94 to history proper ; although , on the other hand , in their historical speculation they seize upon this \'93prehistory\'94 with especial eagerness because they imagine themselves safe there from interference on the part of \'93crude facts ,\'94 and , at the same time , because there they can give full rein to their speculative impulse and set up and knock down hypotheses by the thousand  . \
The third circumstance which , from the very outset , enters into historical development , is that men , who daily remake their own life , begin to make other men , to propagate their kind  : the relation between man and woman , parents and children , the family  .  The family , which to begin with is the only social relationship , becomes later , when increased needs create new social relations and the increased population new needs , a subordinate one (  except in Germany  ) , and must then be treated and analysed according to the existing empirical data , not according to \'93the concept of the family ,\'94 as is the custom in Germany  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\'a0These three aspects of social activity are not of course to be taken as three different stages , but just as three aspects or , to make it clear to the Germans , three \'93moments ,\'94 which have existed simultaneously since the dawn of history and the first men , and which still assert themselves in history today  . \
The production of life , both of one\'92s own in labour and of fresh life in procreation , now appears as a double relationship  : on the one hand as a natural , on the other as a social relationship  .  By social we understand the co-operation of several individuals , no matter under what conditions , in what manner and to what end  .  It follows from this that a certain mode of production , or industrial stage , is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation , or social stage , and this mode of co-operation is itself a \'93productive force  . \'94 Further , that the multitude of productive forces accessible to men determines the nature of society , hence , that the \'93history of humanity\'94 must always be studied and treated in relation to the history of industry and exchange  .  But it is also clear how in Germany it is impossible to write this sort of history , because the Germans lack not only the necessary power of comprehension and the material but also the \'93evidence of their senses ,\'94 for across the Rhine you cannot have any experience of these things since history has stopped happening  .  Thus it is quite obvious from the start that there exists a materialistic connection of men with one another , which is determined by their needs and their mode of production , and which is as old as men themselves  .  This connection is ever taking on new forms , and thus presents a \'93history\'94 independently of the existence of any political or religious nonsense which in addition may hold men together  . \
Only now , after having considered four moments , four aspects of the primary historical relationships , do we find that man also possesses \'93consciousness ,\'94 but , even so , not inherent , not \'93pure\'94 consciousness  .  From the start the \'93spirit\'94 is afflicted with the curse of being \'93burdened\'94 with matter , which here makes its appearance in the form of agitated layers of air , sounds , in short , of language  .  Language is as old as consciousness , language is practical consciousness that exists also for other men ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\'a0and for that reason alone it really exists for me personally as well ; language , like consciousness , only arises from the need , the necessity , of intercourse with other men  .  Where there exists a relationship , it exists for me  : the animal does not enter into \'93relations\'94 with anything , it does not enter into any relation at all  .  For the animal , its relation to others does not exist as a relation  . \'a0Consciousness is , therefore , from the very beginning a social product , and remains so as long as men exist at all  .  Consciousness is at first , of course , merely consciousness concerning the immediate sensuous environment and consciousness of the limited connection with other persons and things outside the individual who is growing self-conscious  .  At the same time it is consciousness of nature , which first appears to men as a completely alien , all-powerful and unassailable force , with which men\'92s relations are purely animal and by which they are overawed like beasts ; it is thus a purely animal consciousness of nature (  natural religion  ) just because nature is as yet hardly modified historically  .  (  We see here immediately  : this natural religion or this particular relation of men to nature is determined by the form of society and vice versa  .  Here , as everywhere , the identity of nature and man appears in such a way that the restricted relation of men to nature determines their restricted relation to one another , and their restricted relation to one another determines men\'92s restricted relation to nature  .   ) On the other hand , man\'92s consciousness of the necessity of associating with the individuals around him is the beginning of the consciousness that he is living in society at all  .  This beginning is as animal as social life itself at this stage  .  It is mere herd-consciousness , and at this point man is only distinguished from sheep by the fact that with him consciousness takes the place of instinct or that his instinct is a conscious one  .  This sheep-like or tribal consciousness receives its further development and extension through increased productivity , the increase of needs , and , what is fundamental to both of these , the increase of population  .  With these there develops the division of labour , which was originally nothing but the division of labour in the sexual act , then that division of labour which develops spontaneously or \'93naturally\'94 by virtue of natural predisposition (  e  . g  .  physical strength  ) , needs , accidents , etc  .  etc  .  Division of labour only becomes truly such from the moment when a division of material and mental labour appears  .  (  The first form of ideologists , priests , is concurrent  .   ) From this moment onwards consciousness can really flatter itself that it is something other than consciousness of existing practice , that it really represents something without representing something real ; from now on consciousness is in a position to emancipate itself from the world and to proceed to the formation of \'93pure\'94 theory , theology , philosophy , ethics , etc  .  But even if this theory , theology , philosophy , ethics , etc  .  comes into contradiction with the existing relations , this can only occur because existing social relations have come into contradiction with existing forces of production ; this , moreover , can also occur in a particular national sphere of relations through the appearance of the contradiction , not within the national orbit , but between this national consciousness and the practice of other nations , i  . e  .  between the national and the general consciousness of a nation (  as we see it now in Germany  )  . \
Moreover , it is quite immaterial what consciousness starts to do on its own  : out of all such muck we get only the one inference that these three moments , the forces of production , the state of society , and consciousness , can and must come into contradiction with one another , because the division of labour implies the possibility , nay the fact that intellectual and material activity \'96 enjoyment and labour , production and consumption \'96 devolve on different individuals , and that the only possibility of their not coming into contradiction lies in the negation in its turn of the division of labour  .  It is self-evident , moreover , that \'93spectres ,\'94 \'93bonds ,\'94 \'93the higher being ,\'94 \'93concept ,\'94 \'93scruple ,\'94 are merely the idealistic , spiritual expression , the conception apparently of the isolated individual , the image of very empirical fetters and limitations , within which the mode of production of life and the form of intercourse coupled with it move  . \
\
\
Private Property and Communism\
With the division of labour , in which all these contradictions are implicit , and which in its turn is based on the natural division of labour in the family and the separation of society into individual families opposed to one another , is given simultaneously the distribution , and indeed the unequal distribution , both quantitative and qualitative , of labour and its products , hence property  : the nucleus , the first form , of which lies in the family , where wife and children are the slaves of the husband  .  This latent slavery in the family , though still very crude , is the first property , but even at this early stage it corresponds perfectly to the definition of modern economists who call it the power of disposing of the labour-power of others  .  Division of labour and private property are , moreover , identical expressions  : in the one the same thing is affirmed with reference to activity as is affirmed in the other with reference to the product of the activity  . \
Further , the division of labour implies the contradiction between the interest of the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals who have intercourse with one another  .  And indeed , this communal interest does not exist merely in the imagination , as the \'93general interest ,\'94 but first of all in reality , as the mutual interdependence of the individuals among whom the labour is divided  .  And finally , the division of labour offers us the first example of how , as long as man remains in natural society , that is , as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest , as long , therefore , as activity is not voluntarily , but naturally , divided , man\'92s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him , which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him  .  For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being , each man has a particular , exclusive sphere of activity , which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape  .  He is a hunter , a fisherman , a herdsman , or a critical critic , and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood ; while in communist society , where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes , society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow , to hunt in the morning , fish in the afternoon , rear cattle in the evening , criticise after dinner , just as I have a mind , without ever becoming hunter , fisherman , herdsman or critic  .  This fixation of social activity , this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective power above us , growing out of our control , thwarting our expectations , bringing to naught our calculations , is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt  [ 2 ]}}\
The social power , i  . e  .  , the multiplied productive force , which arises through the co-operation of different individuals as it is determined by the division of labour , appears to these individuals , since their co-operation is not voluntary but has come about naturally , not as their own united power , but as an alien force existing outside them , of the origin and goal of which they are ignorant , which they thus cannot control , which on the contrary passes through a peculiar series of phases and stages independent of the will and the action of man , nay even being the prime governor of these  . \
How otherwise could , for instance , property have had a history at all , have taken on different forms , and landed property , for example , according to the different premises given , have proceeded in France from parcellation to centralisation in the hands of a few , in England from centralisation in the hands of a few to parcellation , as is actually the case today  ? Or how does it happen that trade , which after all is nothing more than the exchange of products of various individuals and countries , rules the whole world through the relation of supply and demand \'96 a relation which , as an English economist says , hovers over the earth like the fate of the ancients , and with invisible hand allots fortune and misfortune to men , sets up empires and overthrows empires , causes nations to rise and to disappear \'96 while with the abolition of the basis of private property , with the communistic regulation of production (  and , implicit in this , the destruction of the alien relation between men and what they themselves produce  ) , the power of the relation of supply and demand is dissolved into nothing , and men get exchange , production , the mode of their mutual relation , under their own control again  ?\
\
History as a Continuous Process\
In history up to the present it is certainly an empirical fact that separate individuals have , with the broadening of their activity into world-historical activity , become more and more enslaved under a power alien to them (  a pressure which they have conceived of as a dirty trick on the part of the so-called universal spirit , etc  .   ) , a power which has become more and more enormous and , in the last instance , turns out to be the world market  .  But it is just as empirically established that , by the overthrow of the existing state of society by the communist revolution (  of which more below  ) and the abolition of private property which is identical with it , this power , which so baffles the German theoreticians , will be dissolved ; and that then the liberation of each single individual will be accomplished in the measure in which history becomes transformed into world history  .  From the above it is clear that the real intellectual wealth of the individual depends entirely on the wealth of his real connections  .  Only then will the separate individuals be liberated from the various national and local barriers , be brought into practical connection with the material and intellectual production of the whole world and be put in a position to acquire the capacity to enjoy this all-sided production of the whole earth (  the creations of man  )  . \'a0All-round\'a0dependence , this natural form of the world-historical co-operation of individuals , will be transformed by this communist revolution into the control and conscious mastery of these powers , which , born of the action of men on one another , have till now overawed and governed men as powers completely alien to them  .  Now this view can be expressed again in speculative-idealistic , i  . e  .  fantastic , terms as \'93self-generation of the species\'94 (  \'93society as the subject\'94  ) , and thereby the consecutive series of interrelated individuals connected with each other can be conceived as a single individual , which accomplishes the mystery of generating itself  .  It is clear here that individuals certainly make one another , physically and mentally , but do not make themselves  . \
\
 [ 5  .  Development of the Productive Forces as a Material Premise of Communism ]\
This \'93alienation\'94 (  to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers  ) can , of course , only be abolished given two practical premises  .  For it to become an \'93intolerable\'94 power , i  . e  .  a power against which men make a revolution , it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity \'93propertyless ,\'94 and produced , at the same time , the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture , both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power , a high degree of its development  .  And , on the other hand , this development of productive forces (  which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical , instead of local , being  ) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general , and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced ; and furthermore , because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established , which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the \'93propertyless\'94 mass (  universal competition  ) , makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others , and finally has put world-historical , empirically universal individuals in place of local ones  .  Without this , (  1  ) communism could only exist as a local event ; (  2  ) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal , hence intolerable powers  : they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition ; and (  3  ) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism  .  Empirically , communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples \'93all at once\'94 and simultaneously , which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism  .  Moreover , the mass of propertyless workers \'96 the utterly precarious position of labour \'96 power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and , therefore , no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life \'96 presupposes the world market through competition  .  The proletariat can thus only exist\'a0world-historically , just as communism , its activity , can only have a \'93world-historical\'94 existence  .  World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history  . \
Communism is for us not a\'a0state of affairs\'a0which is to be established , an\'a0ideal\'a0to which reality  [ will ] have to adjust itself  .  We call communism the\'a0real\'a0movement which abolishes the present state of things  .  The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence  . \

Civil Society and the Conception of History\
The form of intercourse determined by the existing productive forces at all previous historical stages , and in its turn determining these , is civil society  .  The latter , as is clear from what we have said above , has as its premises and basis the simple family and the multiple , the so-called tribe , the more precise determinants of this society are enumerated in our remarks above  .  Already here we see how this civil society is the true source and theatre of all history , and how absurd is the conception of history held hitherto , which neglects the real relationships and confines itself to high-sounding dramas of princes and states  . \
\
Civil society embraces the whole material intercourse of individuals within a definite stage of the development of productive forces  .  It embraces the whole commercial and industrial life of a given stage and , insofar , transcends the State and the nation , though , on the other hand again , it must assert itself in its foreign relations as nationality , and inwardly must organise itself as State  .  The word \'93civil society\'94  [ b\'fcrgerliche Gesellschaft ] emerged in the eighteenth century , when property relationships had already extricated themselves from the ancient and medieval communal society  .  Civil society as such only develops with the bourgeoisie ; the social organisation evolving directly out of production and commerce , which in all ages forms the basis of the State and of the rest of the idealistic superstructure , has , however , always been designated by the same name  . \
Conclusions from the Materialist Conception of History\
History is nothing but the succession of the separate generations , each of which exploits the materials , the capital funds , the productive forces handed down to it by all preceding generations , and thus , on the one hand , continues the traditional activity in completely changed circumstances and , on the other , modifies the old circumstances with a completely changed activity  .  This can be speculatively distorted so that later history is made the goal of earlier history , e  . g  .  the goal ascribed to the discovery of America is to further the eruption of the French Revolution  .  Thereby history receives its own special aims and becomes \'93a person rating with other persons\'94 (  to wit  : \'93Self-Consciousness , Criticism , the Unique ,\'94 etc  .   ) , while what is designated with the words \'93destiny ,\'94 \'93goal ,\'94 \'93germ ,\'94 or \'93idea\'94 of earlier history is nothing more than an abstraction formed from later history , from the active influence which earlier history exercises on later history  . \
The further the separate spheres , which interact on one another , extend in the course of this development , the more the original isolation of the separate nationalities is destroyed by the developed mode of production and intercourse and the division of labour between various nations naturally brought forth by these , the more history becomes world history  .  Thus , for instance , if in England a machine is invented , which deprives countless workers of bread in India and China , and overturns the whole form of existence of these empires , this invention becomes a world-historical fact  .  Or again , take the case of sugar and coffee which have proved their world-historical importance in the nineteenth century by the fact that the lack of these products , occasioned by the Napoleonic Continental System , caused the Germans to rise against Napoleon , and thus became the real basis of the glorious Wars of liberation of 1813  .  From this it follows that this transformation of history into world history is not indeed a mere abstract act on the part of the \'93self-consciousness ,\'94 the world spirit , or of any other metaphysical spectre , but a quite material , empirically verifiable act , an act the proof of which every individual furnishes as he comes and goes , eats , drinks and clothes himself  . \
\
 [ 7  .  Summary of the Materialist Conception of History ]\
This conception of history depends on our ability to expound the real process of production , starting out from the material production of life itself , and to comprehend the form of intercourse connected with this and created by this mode of production (  i  . e  .  civil society in its various stages  ) , as the basis of all history ; and to show it in its action as State , to explain all the different theoretical products and forms of consciousness , religion , philosophy , ethics , etc  .  etc  .  and trace their origins and growth from that basis ; by which means , of course , the whole thing can be depicted in its totality (  and therefore , too , the reciprocal action of these various sides on one another  )  .  It has not , like the idealistic view of history , in every period to look for a category , but remains constantly on the real ground of history ; it does not explain practice from the idea but explains the formation of ideas from material practice ; and accordingly it comes to the conclusion that all forms and products of consciousness cannot be dissolved by mental criticism , by resolution into \'93self-consciousness\'94 or transformation into \'93apparitions ,\'94 \'93spectres ,\'94 \'93fancies ,\'94 etc  .  but only by the practical overthrow of the actual social relations which gave rise to this idealistic humbug ; that not criticism but revolution is the driving force of history , also of religion , of philosophy and all other types of theory  .  It shows that history does not end by being resolved into \'93self-consciousness as spirit of the spirit ,\'94 but that in it at each stage there is found a material result  : a sum of productive forces , an historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another , which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor ; a mass of productive forces , capital funds and conditions , which , on the one hand , is indeed modified by the new generation , but also on the other prescribes for it its conditions of life and gives it a definite development , a special character  .  It shows that circumstances make men just as much as men make circumstances  . \
This sum of productive forces , capital funds and social forms of intercourse , which every individual and generation finds in existence as something given , is the real basis of what the philosophers have conceived as \'93substance\'94 and \'93essence of man ,\'94 and what they have deified and attacked ; a real basis which is not in the least disturbed , in its effect and influence on the development of men , by the fact that these philosophers revolt against it as \'93self-consciousness\'94 and the \'93Unique  . \'94 These conditions of life , which different generations find in existence , decide also whether or not the periodically recurring revolutionary convulsion will be strong enough to overthrow the basis of the entire existing system  .  And if these material elements of a complete revolution are not present (  namely , on the one hand the existing productive forces , on the other the formation of a revolutionary mass , which revolts not only against separate conditions of society up till then , but against the very \'93production of life\'94 till then , the \'93total activity\'94 on which it was based  ) , then , as far as practical development is concerned , it is absolutely immaterial whether the idea of this revolution has been expressed a hundred times already , as the history of communism proves  . \
 [ 8  .  The Inconsistency of the Idealist Conception of History in General , and of German Post-Hegelian Philosophy in Particular ]\
In the whole conception of history up to the present this real basis of history has either been totally neglected or else considered as a minor matter quite irrelevant to the course of history  .  History must , therefore , always be written according to an extraneous standard ; the real production of life seems to be primeval history , while the truly historical appears to be separated from ordinary life , something extra-superterrestrial  .  With this the relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence the antithesis of nature and history is created  .  The exponents of this conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history the political actions of princes and States , religious and all sorts of theoretical struggles , and in particular in each historical epoch have had to share the illusion of that epoch  .  For instance , if an epoch imagines itself to be actuated by purely \'93political\'94 or \'93religious\'94 motives , although \'93religion\'94 and \'93politics\'94 are only forms of its true motives , the historian accepts this opinion  .  The \'93idea ,\'94 the \'93conception\'94 of the people in question about their real practice , is transformed into the sole determining , active force , which controls and determines their practice  .  When the crude form in which the division of labour appears with the Indians and Egyptians calls forth the caste-system in their State and religion , the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced this crude social form  . \
While the French and the English at least hold by the political illusion , which is moderately close to reality , the Germans move in the realm of the \'93pure spirit ,\'94 and make religious illusion the driving force of history  .  The Hegelian philosophy of history is the last consequence , reduced to its \'93finest expression ,\'94 of all this German historiography , for which it is not a question of real , nor even of political , interests , but of pure thoughts , which consequently must appear to Saint Bruno as a series of \'93thoughts\'94 that devour one another and are finally swallowed up in \'93self-consciousness  . \'94 \'97\

Marginal note by Marx  : So-called\'a0objective\'a0historiography\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume05/footnote.htm#23"}}{\fldrslt  [ 23 ]}}\'a0consisted precisely , in treating the historical relations separately from activity  .  Reactionary character  . \
\'97 and even more consistently the course of history must appear to Saint Max Stirner , who knows not a thing about real history , as a mere \'93tale of knights , robbers and ghosts ,\'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume05/footnote.htm#24"}}{\fldrslt  [ 24 ]}}\'a0from whose visions he can , of course , only save himself by \'93unholiness\'94  .  This conception is truly religious  : it postulates religious man as the primitive man , the starting-point of history , and in its imagination puts the religious production of fancies in the place of the real production of the means of subsistence and of life itself  . \
This whole conception of history , together with its dissolution and the scruples and qualms resulting from it , is a purely national affair of the Germans and has merely local interest for Germany , as for instance the important question which has been under discussion in recent times  : how exactly one \'93passes from the realm of God to the realm of Man\'94\'a0 [ Ludwig Feuerbach ,\'a0Ueber das Wesen des Christenthums ]\'a0\'96 as if this \'93realm of God\'94 had ever existed anywhere save in the imagination , and the learned gentlemen , without being aware of it , were not constantly living in the \'93realm of Man\'94 to which they are now seeking the way ; and as if the learned pastime (  for it is nothing more  ) of explaining the mystery of this theoretical bubble-blowing did not on the contrary lie in demonstrating its origin in actual earthly relations  .  For these Germans , it is altogether simply a matter of resolving the ready-made nonsense they find into some other freak , i  . e  .  , of presupposing that all this nonsense has a special\'a0sense\'a0which can be discovered ; while really it is only a question of explaining these theoretical phrases from the actual existing relations  .  The real , practical dissolution of these phrases , the removal of these notions from the consciousness of men , will , as we have already said , be effected by altered circumstances , not by theoretical deductions  .  For the mass of men , i  . e  .  , the proletariat , these theoretical notions do not exist and hence do not require to be dissolved , and if this mass ever had any theoretical notions , e  . g  .  , religion , these have now long been dissolved by circumstances  . \
The purely national character of these questions and solutions is moreover shown by the fact that these theorists believe in all seriousness that chimeras like \'93the God-Man ,\'94 \'93Man ,\'94 etc  .  , have presided over individual epochs of history (  Saint Bruno even goes so far as to assert that only \'93criticism and critics have made history ,\'94\'a0 [ Bruno Bauer ,\'a0Charakteristik Ludwig Feuerbachs ]\'a0and when they themselves construct historical systems , they skip over all earlier periods in the greatest haste and pass immediately from \'93Mongolism\'94\'a0 [ Max Stirner ,\'a0Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum ]\'a0to history \'93with meaningful content ,\'94 that is to say , to the history , of the\'a0Hallische and Deutsche Jahrb\'fccher\'a0and the dissolution of the Hegelian school into a general squabble  .  They forget all other nations , all real events , and the\'a0theatrum mundi\'a0is confined to the Leipzig book fair and the mutual quarrels of \'93criticism ,\'94\'a0 [ Bruno Bauer ]\'a0\'93man ,\'94\'a0 [ Ludwig Feuerbach ]\'a0and \'93the unique\'94  . \'a0 [ Max Stirner ]\'a0If for once these theorists treat really historical subjects , as for instance the eighteenth century , they merely give a history of ideas , separated from the facts and the practical development underlying them ; and even that merely in order to represent that period as an imperfect preliminary stage , the as yet limited predecessor of the truly historical age , i  . e  .  , the period of the German philosophic struggle from 1840 to 1844  .  As might be expected when the history of an earlier period is written with the aim of accentuating the brilliance of an unhistoric person and his fantasies , all the really historic events , even the really historic interventions of politics in history , receive no mention  .  Instead we get a narrative based not on research but on arbitrary constructions and literary gossip , such as Saint Bruno provided in his now forgotten history of the eighteenth century  . \'a0 [ Bruno Bauer ,\'a0Geschichte der Politik , Cultur und Aufkl\'e4rung des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts ]\'a0These pompous and arrogant hucksters of ideas , who imagine themselves infinitely exalted above all national prejudices , are thus in practice far more national than the beer-swilling philistines who dream of a united Germany  .  They do not recognise the deeds of other nations as historical ; they live in Germany , within Germany 1281 and for Germany ; they turn the Rhine-song\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume05/footnote.htm#25"}}{\fldrslt  [ 25 ]}}\'a0into a religious hymn and conquer Alsace and Lorraine by robbing French philosophy instead of the French state , by Germanising French ideas instead of French provinces  .  Herr Venedey is a cosmopolitan compared with the Saints Bruno and Max , who , in the universal dominance of theory , proclaim the universal dominance of Germany  . \
\
Feuerbach  : Philosophic , and Real , Liberation\
 [   .   .   .  ] It is also clear from these arguments how grossly Feuerbach is deceiving himself when (  Wigand\'92s\'a0Vierteljahrsschrift , 1845 , Band 2  ) by virtue of the qualification \'93common man\'94 he declares himself a communist ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume05/footnote.htm#26"}}{\fldrslt  [ 26 ]}}\'a0transforms the latter into a predicate of \'93man ,\'94 and thereby thinks it possible to change the word \'93communist ,\'94 which in the real world means the follower of a definite revolutionary party , into a mere category  .  Feuerbach\'92s whole deduction with regard to the relation of men to one another goes only so far as to prove that men need and always have needed each other  .  He wants to establish consciousness of this fact , that is to say , like the other theorists , merely to produce a correct consciousness about an existing fact ; whereas for the real communist it is a question of overthrowing the existing state of things  .  We thoroughly appreciate , moreover , that Feuerbach , in endeavouring to produce consciousness of just this fact , is going as far as a theorist possibly can , without ceasing to be a theorist and philosopher  .   .   . \
As an example of Feuerbach\'92s acceptance and at the same time misunderstanding of existing reality , which he still shares with our opponents , we recall the passage in the\'a0Philosophie der Zukunft\'a0where he develops the view that the existence of a thing or a man is at the same time its or his essence , that the conditions of existence , the mode of life and activity of an animal or human individual are those in which its \'93essence\'94 feels itself satisfied  .  Here every exception is expressly conceived as an unhappy chance , as an abnormality which cannot be altered  .  Thus if millions of proletarians feel by no means contented with their living conditions , if their \'93existence\'94 does not in the least correspond to their \'93essence ,\'94 then , according to the passage quoted , this is an unavoidable misfortune , which must be borne quietly  .  The millions of proletarians and communists , however , think differently and will prove this in time , when they bring their \'93existence\'94 into harmony with their \'93essence\'94 in a practical way , by means of a revolution  .  Feuerbach , therefore , never speaks of the world of man in such cases , but always takes refuge in external nature , and moreover in nature which has not yet been subdued by men  .  But every new invention , every advance made by industry , detaches another piece from this domain , so that the ground which produces examples illustrating such Feuerbachian propositions is steadily shrinking  . \
\
The \'93essence\'94 of the fish is its \'93being ,\'94 water \'96 to go no further than this one proposition  .  The \'93essence\'94 of the freshwater fish is the water of a river  .  But the latter ceases to be the \'93essence\'94 of the fish and is no longer a suitable medium of existence as soon as the river is made to serve industry , as soon as it is polluted by dyes and other waste products and navigated by steamboats , or as soon as its water is diverted into canals where simple drainage can deprive the fish of its medium of existence  .  The explanation that all such contradictions are inevitable abnormalities does not essentially differ from the consolation which Saint Max Stirner offers to the discontented , saving that this contradiction is their own contradiction and this predicament their own predicament , whereupon then , should either set their minds at ease , keep their disgust to themselves , or revolt against it in some fantastic way  .  It differs just as little from Saint Bruno\'92s allegation that these unfortunate circumstances are due to the fact that those concerned are stuck in the muck of \'93substance ,\'94 have not advanced to \'93absolute self-consciousness and do not realise that these adverse conditions are spirit of their spirit  . \
\
 [ II  .  1  .  Preconditions of the Real Liberation of Man ]\
 [   .   .   .  ] We shall , of course , not take the trouble to enlighten our wise philosophers by explaining to them that the \'93liberation\'94 of man is not advanced a single step by reducing philosophy , theology , substance and all the trash to \'93self-consciousness\'94 and by liberating man from the domination of these phrases , which have never held him in thrall  .  Nor will we explain to them that it is only possible to achieve real liberation in the real world and by employing real means , that slavery cannot be abolished without the steam-engine and the mule and spinning-jenny , serfdom cannot be abolished without improved agriculture , and that , in general , people cannot be liberated as long as they are unable to obtain food and drink , housing and clothing in adequate quality and quantity  .  \'93Liberation\'94 is an historical and not a mental act , and it is brought about by historical conditions , the development of industry , commerce , agriculture , the conditions of intercourse  .   .   .  [ There is here a gap in the manuscript ]\
In Germany , a country where only a trivial historical development is taking place , these mental developments , these glorified and ineffective trivialities , naturally serve as a substitute for the lack of historical development , and they take root and have to be combated  .  But this fight is of local importance  . \
 [ 2  .  Feuerbach\'92s Contemplative and Inconsistent Materialism ]\
In reality and for the practical materialist , i  . e  .  the communist , it is a question of revolutionising the existing world , of practically attacking and changing existing things  .  When occasionally we find such views with Feuerbach , they are never more than isolated surmises and have much too little influence on his general outlook to be considered here as anything else than embryos capable of development  .  Feuerbach\'92s conception of the sensuous world is confined on the one hand to mere contemplation of it , and on the other to mere feeling ; he says \'93Man\'94 instead of \'93real historical man  . \'94 \'93Man\'94 is really \'93the German  . \'94 In the first case , the contemplation of the sensuous world , he necessarily lights on things which contradict his consciousness and feeling , which disturb the harmony he presupposes , the harmony of all parts of the sensuous world and especially of man and nature  .  To remove this disturbance , he must take refuge in a double perception , a profane one which only perceives the \'93flatly obvious\'94 and a higher , philosophical , one which perceives the \'93true essence\'94 of things  .  He does not see how the sensuous world around him is , not a thing given direct from all eternity , remaining ever the same , but the product of industry and of the state of society ; and , indeed , in the sense that it is an historical product , the result of the activity of a whole succession of generations , each standing on the shoulders of the preceding one , developing its industry and its intercourse , modifying its social system according to the changed needs  .  Even the objects of the simplest \'93sensuous certainty\'94 are only given him through social development , industry and commercial intercourse  .  The cherry-tree , like almost all fruit-trees , was , as is well known , only a few centuries ago transplanted by commerce into our zone , and therefore only by this action of a definite society in a definite age it has become \'93sensuous certainty\'94 for Feuerbach  . \
Incidentally , when we conceive things thus , as they really are and happened , every profound philosophical problem is resolved , as will be seen even more clearly later , quite simply into an empirical fact  .  For instance , the important question of the relation of man to nature (  Bruno\'a0 [ Bauer ]\'a0goes so far as to speak of \'93the antitheses in nature and history\'94 (  p  .  110  ) , as though these were two separate \'93things\'94 and man did not always have before him an historical nature and a natural history  ) out of which all the \'93unfathomably lofty works\'94 on \'93substance\'94 and \'93self-consciousness\'94 were born , crumbles of itself when we understand that the celebrated \'93unity of man with nature\'94 has always existed in industry and has existed in varying forms in every epoch according to the lesser or greater development of industry , just like the \'93struggle\'94 of man with nature , right up to the development of his productive powers on a corresponding basis  .  Industry and commerce , production and the exchange of the necessities of life , themselves determine distribution , the structure of the different social classes and are , in turn , determined by it as to the mode in which they are carried on ; and so it happens that in Manchester , for instance , Feuerbach sees only factories and machines , where a hundred years ago only spinning-wheels and weaving-rooms were to be seen , or in the Campagna of Rome he finds only pasture lands and swamps , where in the time of Augustus he would have found nothing but the vineyards and villas of Roman capitalists  .  Feuerbach speaks in particular of the perception of natural science ; he mentions secrets which are disclosed only to the eye of the physicist and chemist ; but where would natural science be without industry and commerce  ? Even this pure natural science is provided with an aim , as with its material , only through trade and industry , through the sensuous activity of men  .  So much is this activity , this unceasing sensuous labour and creation , this production , the basis of the whole sensuous world as it now exists , that , were it interrupted only for a year , Feuerbach would not only find an enormous change in the natural world , but would very soon find that the whole world of men and his own perceptive faculty , nay his own existence , were missing  .  Of course , in all this the priority of external nature remains unassailed , and all this has no application to the original men produced by\'a0generatio aequivoca\'a0 [ spontaneous generation ] ; but this differentiation has meaning only insofar as man is considered to be distinct from nature  .  For that matter , nature , the nature that preceded human history , is not by any means the nature in which Feuerbach lives , it is nature which today no longer exists anywhere (  except perhaps on a few Australian coral-islands of recent origin  ) and which , therefore , does not exist for Feuerbach  . \
Certainly Feuerbach has a great advantage over the \'93pure\'94 materialists in that he realises how man too is an \'93object of the senses  . \'94 But apart from the fact that he only conceives him as an \'93object of the senses , not as sensuous activity ,\'94 because he still remains in the realm of theory and conceives of men not in their given social connection , not under their existing conditions of life , which have made them\'a0what\'a0they are , he never arrives at the really existing active men , but stops at the abstraction \'93man ,\'94 and gets no further than recognising \'93the true , individual , corporeal man ,\'94 emotionally , i  . e  .  he knows no other \'93human relationships\'94 \'93of man to man\'94 than love and friendship , and even then idealised  .  He gives no criticism of the present conditions of life  .  Thus he never manages to conceive the sensuous world as the total living sensuous\'a0activity\'a0of the individuals composing it ; and therefore when , for example , he sees instead of healthy men a crowd of scrofulous , overworked and consumptive starvelings , he is compelled to take refuge in the \'93higher perception\'94 and in the ideal \'93compensation in the species ,\'94 and thus to relapse into idealism at the very point where the communist materialist sees the necessity , and at the same time the condition , of a transformation both of industry and of the social structure  . \
As far as Feuerbach is a materialist he does not deal with history , and as far as he considers history he is not a materialist  .  With him materialism and history diverge completely , a fact which incidentally is already obvious from what has been said  . \
\
Ruling Class and Ruling Ideas\
The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas , i  . e  .  the class which is the ruling material force of society , is at the same time its ruling intellectual force  .  The class which has the means of material production at its disposal , has control at the same time over the means of mental production , so that thereby , generally speaking , the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it  .  The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships , the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas ; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one , therefore , the ideas of its dominance  .  The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness , and therefore think  .  Insofar , therefore , as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch , it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range , hence among other things rule also as thinkers , as producers of ideas , and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age  : thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch  .  For instance , in an age and in a country where royal power , aristocracy , and bourgeoisie are contending for mastery and where , therefore , mastery is shared , the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an \'93eternal law  . \'94\
The division of labour , which we already saw above as one of the chief forces of history up till now , manifests itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labour , so that inside this class one part appears as the thinkers of the class (  its active , conceptive ideologists , who make the perfecting of the illusion of the class about itself their chief source of livelihood  ) , while the others\'92 attitude to these ideas and illusions is more passive and receptive , because they are in reality the active members of this class and have less time to make up illusions and ideas about themselves  .  Within this class this cleavage can even develop into a certain opposition and hostility between the two parts , which , however , in the case of a practical collision , in which the class itself is endangered , automatically comes to nothing , in which case there also vanishes the semblance that the ruling ideas were not the ideas of the ruling class and had a power distinct from the power of this class  .  The existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class ; about the premises for the latter sufficient has already been said above  . \
If now in considering the course of history we detach the ideas of the ruling class from the ruling class itself and attribute to them an independent existence , if we confine ourselves to saying that these or those ideas were dominant at a given time , without bothering ourselves about the conditions of production and the producers of these ideas , if we thus ignore the individuals and world conditions which are the source of the ideas , we can say , for instance , that during the time that the aristocracy was dominant , the concepts honour , loyalty , etc  .  were dominant , during the dominance of the bourgeoisie the concepts freedom , equality , etc  .  The ruling class itself on the whole imagines this to be so  .  This conception of history , which is common to all historians , particularly since the eighteenth century , will necessarily come up against the phenomenon that increasingly abstract ideas hold sway , i  . e  .  ideas which increasingly take on the form of universality  .  For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it , is compelled , merely in order to carry through its aim , to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society , that is , expressed in ideal form  : it has to give its ideas the form of universality , and represent them as the only rational , universally valid ones  .  The class making a revolution appears from the very start , if only because it is opposed to a class , not as a class but as the representative of the whole of society ; it appears as the whole mass of society confronting the one ruling class  .  \'94 \'97\
\
Marginal note by Marx  : Universality corresponds to (  1  ) the class versus the estate , (  2  ) the competition , world-wide intercourse , etc  .  , (  3  ) the great numerical strength of the ruling class , (  4  ) the illusion of the common interests (  in the beginning this illusion is true  ) , (  5  ) the delusion of the ideologists and the division of labour  . \
\'97 It can do this because , to start with , its interest really is more connected with the common interest of all other non-ruling classes , because under the pressure of hitherto existing conditions its interest has not yet been able to develop as the particular interest of a particular class  .  Its victory , therefore , benefits also many individuals of the other classes which are not winning a dominant position , but only insofar as it now puts these individuals in a position to raise themselves into the ruling class  .  When the French bourgeoisie overthrew the power of the aristocracy , it thereby made it possible for many proletarians to raise themselves above the proletariat , but only insofar as they become bourgeois  .  Every new class , therefore , achieves its hegemony only on a broader basis than that of the class ruling previously , whereas the opposition of the non-ruling class against the new ruling class later develops all the more sharply and profoundly  .  Both these things determine the fact that the struggle to be waged against this new ruling class , in its turn , aims at a more decided and radical negation of the previous conditions of society than could all previous classes which sought to rule  . \
This whole semblance , that the rule of a certain class is only the rule of certain ideas , comes to a natural end , of course , as soon as class rule in general ceases to be the form in which society is organised , that is to say , as soon as it is no longer necessary to represent a particular interest as general or the \'93general interest\'94 as ruling  . \
Once the ruling ideas have been separated from the ruling individuals and , above all , from the relationships which result from a given stage of the mode of production , and in this way the conclusion has been reached that history is always under the sway of ideas , it is very easy to abstract from these various ideas \'93the idea ,\'94 the notion , etc  .  as the dominant force in history , and thus to understand all these separate ideas and concepts as \'93forms of self-determination\'94 on the part of the concept developing in history  .  It follows then naturally , too , that all the relationships of men can be derived from the concept of man , man as conceived , the essence of man , Man  .  This has been done by the speculative philosophers  .  Hegel himself confesses at the end of the\'a0Geschichtsphilosophie\'a0that he \'93has considered the progress of the concept only\'94 and has represented in history the \'93true theodicy  . \'94 (  p  . 446  .   ) Now one can go back again to the producers of the \'93concept ,\'94 to the theorists , ideologists and philosophers , and one comes then to the conclusion that the philosophers , the thinkers as such , have at all times been dominant in history  : a conclusion , as we see{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume05/footnote.htm#27"}}{\fldrslt  [ 27 ]}} , already expressed by Hegel  .  The whole trick of proving the hegemony of the spirit in history (  hierarchy Stirner calls it  ) is thus confined to the following three efforts  . \
No  .  1  .  One must separate the ideas of those ruling for empirical reasons , under empirical conditions and as empirical individuals , from these actual rulers , and thus recognise the rule of ideas or illusions in history  . \
No  .  2  .  One must bring an order into this rule of ideas , prove a mystical connection among the successive ruling ideas , which is managed by understanding them as \'93acts of self-determination on the part of the concept\'94 (  this is possible because by virtue of their empirical basis these ideas are really connected with one another and because , conceived as mere ideas , they become self-distinctions , distinctions made by thought  )  . \
No  .  3  .  To remove the mystical appearance of this \'93self-determining concept\'94 it is changed into a person \'96 \'93Self-Consciousness\'94 \'96 or , to appear thoroughly materialistic , into a series of persons , who represent the \'93concept\'94 in history , into the \'93thinkers ,\'94 the \'93philosophers ,\'94 the ideologists , who again are understood as the manufacturers of history , as the \'93council of guardians ,\'94 as the rulers  .  Thus the whole body of materialistic elements has been removed from history and now full rein can be given to the speculative steed  . \
Whilst in ordinary life every shopkeeper is very well able to distinguish between what somebody professes to be and what he really is , our historians have not yet won even this trivial insight  .  They take every epoch at its word and believe that everything it says and imagines about itself is true  . \
\
This historical method which reigned in Germany , and especially the reason why , must be understood from its connection with the illusion of ideologists in general , e  . g  .  the illusions of the jurist , politicians (  of the practical statesmen among them , too  ) , from the dogmatic dreamings and distortions of these fellows ; this is explained perfectly easily from their practical position in life , their job , and the division of labour  . \

Division of Labour  : Town and Country\
 [   .   .   .  ]\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01c.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\'a0From the first there follows the premise of a highly developed division of labour and an extensive commerce ; from the second , the locality  .  In the first case the individuals must be brought together ; in the second they find themselves alongside the given instrument of production as instruments of production themselves  .  Here , therefore , arises the difference between natural instruments of production and those created by civilisation  .  The field (  water , etc  .   ) can be regarded as a natural instrument of production  .  In the first case , that of the natural instrument of production , individuals are subservient to nature ; in the second , to a product of labour  .  In the first case , therefore , property (  landed property  ) appears as direct natural domination , in the second , as domination of labour , particularly of accumulated labour , capital  .  The first case presupposes that the individuals are united by some bond  : family , tribe , the land itself , etc  .  ; the second , that they are independent of one another and are only held together by exchange  .  In the first case , what is involved is chiefly an exchange between men and nature in which the labour of the former is exchanged for the products of the latter ; in the second , it is predominantly an exchange of men among themselves  .  In the first case , average , human common sense is adequate \'97 physical activity is as yet not separated from mental activity ; in the second , the division between physical and mental labour must already be practically completed  .  In the first case , the domination of the proprietor over the propertyless may be based on a personal relationship , on a kind of community ; in the second , it must have taken on a material shape in a third party - money  .  In the first case , small industry exists , but determined by the utilisation of the natural instrument of production and therefore without the distribution of labour among various individuals ; in the second , industry exists only in and through the division of labour  . \
\
 [ 2  .  The Division of Material and Mental Labour  . \uc0\u8232 Separation of Town and Country , The Guild System ]\
The greatest division of material and mental labour is the separation of town and country  .  The antagonism between town and country begins with the transition from barbarism to civilisation , from tribe to State , from locality to nation , and runs through the whole history of civilisation to the present day (  the Anti-Corn Law League  )  . \
The existence of the town implies , at the same time , the necessity of administration , police , taxes , etc  .  ; in short , of the municipality , and thus of politics in general  .  Here first became manifest the division of the population into two great classes , which is directly based on the division of labour and on the instruments of production  .  The town already is in actual fact the concentration of the population , of the instruments of production , of capital , of pleasures , of needs , while the country demonstrates just the opposite fact , isolation and separation  .  The antagonism between town and country can only exist within the framework of private property  .  It is the most crass expression of the subjection of the individual under the division of labour , under a definite activity forced upon him \'97 a subjection which makes one man into a restricted town-animal , the other into a restricted country-animal , and daily creates anew the conflict between their interests  .  Labour is here again the chief thing , power over individuals , and as long as the latter exists , private property must exist  .  The abolition of the antagonism between town and country is one of the first conditions of communal life , a condition which again depends on a mass of material premises and which cannot be fulfilled by the mere will , as anyone can see at the first glance  .  (  These conditions have still to be enumerated  .   ) The separation of town and country can also be understood as the separation of capital and landed property , as the beginning of the existence and development of capital independent of landed property \'97 the beginning of property having its basis only in labour and exchange  . \
In the towns which , in the Middle Ages , did not derive ready-made from an earlier period but were formed anew by the serfs who had become free , each man's own particular labour was his only property apart from the small capital he brought with him , consisting almost solely of the most necessary tools of his craft  .  The competition of serfs constantly escaping into the town , the constant war of the country against the towns and thus the necessity of an organised municipal military force , the bond of common ownership in a particular kind of labour , the necessity of common buildings for the sale of their wares at a time when craftsmen were also traders , and the consequent exclusion of the unauthorised from these buildings , the conflict among the interests of the various crafts , the necessity of protecting their laboriously acquired skill , and the feudal organisation of the whole of the country  : these were the causes of the union of the workers of each craft in guilds  .  We have not at this point to go further into the manifold modifications of the guild-system , which arise through later historical developments  .  The flight of the serfs into the towns went on without interruption right through the Middle Ages  .  These serfs , persecuted by their lords in the country , came separately into the towns , where they found an organised community , against which they were powerless and in which they had to subject themselves to the station assigned to them by the demand for their labour and the interest of their organised urban competitors  .  These workers , entering separately , were never able to attain to any power , since , if their labour was of the guild type which had to be learned , the guild-masters bent them to their will and organised them according to their interest ; or if their labour was not such as had to be learned , and therefore not of the guild type , they became day-labourers and never managed to organise , remaining an unorganised rabble  .  The need for day-labourers in the towns created the rabble  . \
These towns were true   "  associations  "   , called forth by the direct need , the care of providing for the protection of property , and of multiplying the means of production and defence of the separate members  .  The rabble of these towns was devoid of any power , composed as it was of individuals strange to one another who had entered separately , and who stood unorganised over against an organised power , armed for war , and jealously watching over them  .  The journeymen and apprentices were organised in each craft as it best suited the interest of the masters  .  The patriarchal relationship existing between them and their masters gave the latter a double power \'97 on the one hand because of their influence on the whole life of the journeymen , and on the other because , for the journeymen who worked with the same master , it was a real bond which held them together against the journeymen of other masters and separated them from these  .  And finally , the journeymen were bound to the existing order by their simple interest in becoming masters themselves  .  While , therefore , the rabble at least carried out revolts against the whole municipal order , revolts which remained completely ineffective because of their powerlessness , the journeymen never got further than small acts of insubordination within separate guilds , such as belong to the very nature of the guild-system  .  The great risings of the Middle Ages all radiated from the country , but equally remained totally ineffective because of the isolation and consequent crudity of the peasants  . \
In the towns , the division of labour between the individual guilds was as yet  [ quite naturally derived ] and , in the guilds themselves , not at all developed between the individual workers  .  Every workman had to be versed in a whole round of tasks , had to be able to make everything that was to be made with his tools  .  The limited commerce and the scanty communication between the individual towns , the lack of population and the narrow needs did not allow of a higher division of labour , and therefore every man who wished to become a master had to be proficient in the whole of his craft  .  Thus there is found with medieval craftsmen an interest in their special work and in proficiency in it , which was capable of rising to a narrow artistic sense  .  For this very reason , however , every medieval craftsman was completely absorbed in his work , to which he had a contented , slavish relationship , and to which he was subjected to a far greater extent than the modern worker , whose work is a matter of indifference to him  . \
Capital in these towns was a naturally derived capital , consisting of a house , the tools of the craft , and the natural , hereditary customers ; and not being realisable , on account of the backwardness of commerce and the lack of circulation , it descended from father to son  .  Unlike modern capital , which can be assessed in money and which may be indifferently invested in this thing or that , this capital was directly connected with the particular work of the owner , inseparable from it and to this extent estate capital  . \
Further Division of Labour\
The next extension of the division of labour was the separation of production and commerce , the formation of a special class of merchants ; a separation which , in the towns bequeathed by a former period , had been handed down (  among other things with the Jews  ) and which very soon appeared in the newly formed ones  .  With this there was given the possibility of commercial communications transcending the immediate neighbourhood , a possibility , the realisation of which depended on the existing means of communication , the state of public safety in the countryside , which was determined by political conditions (  during the whole of the Middle Ages , as is well known , the merchants travelled in armed caravans  ) , and on the cruder or more advanced needs (  determined by the stage of culture attained  ) of the region accessible to intercourse  . \
With commerce the prerogative of a particular class , with the extension of trade through the merchants beyond the immediate surroundings of the town , there immediately appears a reciprocal action between production and commerce  .  The towns enter into relations with one another , new tools are brought from one town into the other , and the separation between production and commerce soon calls forth a new division of production between the individual towns , each of which is soon exploiting a predominant branch of industry  .  The local restrictions of earlier times begin gradually to be broken down  . \
It depends purely on the extension of commerce whether the productive forces achieved in a locality , especially inventions , are lost for later development or not  .  As long as there exists no commerce transcending the immediate neighbourhood , every invention must be made separately in each locality , and mere chances such as irruptions of barbaric peoples , even ordinary wars , are sufficient to cause a country with advanced productive forces and needs to have to start right over again from the beginning  .  In primitive history every invention had to be made daily anew and in each locality independently  .  How little highly developed productive forces are safe from complete destruction , given even a relatively very extensive commerce , is proved by the Phoenicians , whose inventions were for the most part lost for a long time to come through the ousting of this nation from commerce , its conquest by Alexander and its consequent decline  .  Likewise , for instance , glass-painting in the Middle Ages  .  Only when commerce has become world commerce and has as its basis large-scale industry , when all nations are drawn into the competitive struggle , is the permanence of the acquired productive forces assured  . \
\
The Rise of Manufacturing\
The immediate consequence of the division of labour between the various towns was the rise of manufactures , branches of production which had outgrown the guild-system  .  Manufactures first flourished , in Italy and later in Flanders , under the historical premise of commerce with foreign nations  .  In other countries , England and France for example , manufactures were at first confined to the home market  .  Besides the premises already mentioned manufactures depend on an already advanced concentration of population , particularly in the countryside , and of capital , which began to accumulate in the hands of individuals , partly in the guilds in spite of the guild regulations , partly among the merchants  . \
That labour which from the first presupposed a machine , even of the crudest sort , soon showed itself the most capable of development  .  Weaving , earlier carried on in the country by the peasants as a secondary occupation to procure their clothing , was the first labour to receive an impetus and a further development through the extension of commerce  .  Weaving was the first and remained the principal manufacture  .  The rising demand for clothing materials , consequent on the growth of population , the growing accumulation and mobilisation of natural capital through accelerated circulation , the demand for luxuries called forth by the latter and favoured generally by the gradual extension of commerce , gave weaving a quantitative and qualitative stimulus , which wrenched it out of the form of production hitherto existing  .  Alongside the peasants weaving for their own use , who continued , and still continue , with this sort of work , there emerged a new class of weavers in the towns , whose fabrics were destined for the whole home market and usually for foreign markets too  . \
Weaving , an occupation demanding in most cases little skill and soon splitting up into countless branches , by its whole nature resisted the trammels of the guild  .  Weaving was , therefore , carried on mostly in villages and market-centres without guild organisation , which gradually became towns , and indeed the most flourishing towns in each land  . \
With guild-free manufacture , property relations also quickly changed  .  The first advance beyond naturally derived estate capital was provided by the rise of merchants whose capital was from the beginning movable , capital in the modern sense as far as one can speak of it , given the circumstances of those times  .  The second advance came with manufacture , which again made mobile a mass of natural capital , and altogether increased the mass of movable capital as against that of natural capital  . \
At the same time , manufacture became a refuge of the peasants from the guilds which excluded them or paid them badly , just as earlier the guild-towns had  [ served ] as a refuge for the peasants from  [ the oppressive landed nobility ]  . \
Simultaneously with the beginning of manufactures there was a period of vagabondage caused by the abolition of the feudal bodies of retainers , the disbanding of the swollen armies which had flocked to serve the kings against their vassals , the improvement of agriculture , and the transformation of great strips of tillage into pasture land  .  From this alone it is clear how this vagabondage is strictly connected with the disintegration of the feudal system  .  As early as the thirteenth century we find isolated epochs of this kind , but only at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth does this vagabondage make a general and permanent appearance  .  These vagabonds , who were so numerous that , for instance , Henry VIII of England had 72 ,000 of them hanged , were only prevailed upon to work with the greatest difficulty and through the most extreme necessity , and then only after long resistance  .  The rapid rise of manufactures , particularly in England , absorbed them gradually  . \
With the advent of manufactures , the various nations entered into a competitive relationship , the struggle for trade , which was fought out in wars , protective duties and prohibitions , whereas earlier the nations , insofar as they were connected at all , had carried on an inoffensive exchange with each other  .  Trade had from now on a political significance  . \
With the advent of manufacture the relationship between worker and employer changed  .  In the guilds the patriarchal relationship between journeyman and master continued to exist ; in manufacture its place was taken by the monetary relation between worker and capitalist \'97 a relationship which in the countryside and in small towns retained a patriarchal tinge , but in the larger , the real manufacturing towns , quite early lost almost all patriarchal complexion  . \
Manufacture and the movement of production in general received an enormous impetus through the extension of commerce which came with the discovery of America and the sea-route to the East Indies  .  The new products imported thence , particularly the masses of gold and silver which came into circulation and totally changed the position of the classes towards one another , dealing a hard blow to feudal landed property and to the workers ; the expeditions of adventurers , colonisation ; and above all the extension of markets into a world market , which had now become possible and was daily becoming more and more a fact , called forth a new phase of historical development , into which in general we cannot here enter further  .  Through the colonisation of the newly discovered countries the commercial struggle of the nations amongst one another was given new fuel and accordingly greater extension and animosity  . \
The expansion of trade and manufacture accelerated the accumulation of movable capital , while in the guilds , which were not stimulated to extend their production , natural capital remained stationary or even declined  .  Trade and manufacture created the big bourgeoisie ; in the guilds was concentrated the petty bourgeoisie , which no longer was dominant in the towns as formerly , but had to bow to the might of the great merchants and manufacturers  .  Hence the decline of the guilds , as soon as they came into contact with manufacture  . \
The intercourse of nations took on , in the epoch of which we have been speaking , two different forms  .  At first the small quantity of gold and silver in circulation involved the ban on the export of these metals ; and industry , for the most part imported from abroad and made necessary by the need for employing the growing urban population , could not do without those privileges which could be granted not only , of course , against home competition , but chiefly against foreign  .  The local guild privilege was in these original prohibitions extended over the whole nation  .  Customs duties originated from the tributes which the feudal lords exacted as protective levies against robbery from merchants passing through their territories , tributes later imposed likewise by the towns , and which , with the rise of the modern states , were the Treasury's most obvious means of raising money  . \
The appearance of American gold and silver on the European markets , the gradual development of industry , the rapid expansion of trade and the consequent rise of the non-guild bourgeoisie and of money , gave these measures another significance  .  The State , which was daily less and less able to do without money , now retained the ban on the export of gold and silver out of fiscal considerations ; the bourgeois , for whom these masses of money which were hurled onto the market became the chief object of speculative buying , were thoroughly content with this ; privileges established earlier became a source of income for the government and were sold for money ; in the customs legislation there appeared the export duty , which , since it only  [ placed ] a hindrance in the way of industry , had a purely fiscal aim  . \
The second period began in the middle of the seventeenth century and lasted almost to the end of the eighteenth  .  Commerce and navigation had expanded more rapidly than manufacture , which played a secondary role ; the colonies were becoming considerable consumers ; and after long struggles the separate nations shared out the opening world market among themselves  .  This period begins with the Navigation Laws\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01c.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt  [ 2 ]}}\'a0and colonial monopolies  .  The competition of the nations among themselves was excluded as far as possible by tariffs , prohibitions and treaties ; and in the last resort the competitive struggle was carried on and decided by wars (  especially naval wars  )  .  The mightiest maritime nation , the English , retained preponderance in trade and manufacture  .  Here , already , we find concentration in one country  . \
Manufacture was all the time sheltered by protective duties in the home market , by monopolies in the colonial market , and abroad as much as possible by differential duties  .  The working-up of home-produced material was encouraged (  wool and linen in England , silk in France  ) , the export of home-produced raw material forbidden (  wool in England  ) , and the  [ working-up ] of imported material neglected or suppressed (  cotton in England  )  .  The nation dominant in sea trade and colonial power naturally secured for itself also the greatest quantitative and qualitative expansion of manufacture  .  Manufacture could not be carried on without protection , since , if the slightest change takes place in other countries , it can lose its market and be ruined ; under reasonably favourable conditions it may easily be introduced into a country , but for this very reason can easily be destroyed  .  At the same time through the mode in which it is carried on , particularly in the eighteenth century , in the countryside , it is to such an extent interwoven with the vital relationships of a great mass of individuals , that no country dare jeopardise its existence by permitting free competition  .  Insofar as it manages to export , it therefore depends entirely on the extension or restriction of commerce , and exercises a relatively very small reaction  [ on the latter ]  .  Hence its secondary  [ importance ] and the influence of  [ the merchants ] in the eighteenth century  .  It was the merchants and especially the shippers who more than anybody else pressed for State protection and monopolies ; the manufacturers also demanded and indeed received protection , but all the time were inferior in political importance to the merchants  .  The commercial towns , particularly the maritime towns , became to some extent civilised and acquired the outlook of the big bourgeoisie , but in the factory towns an extreme petty-bourgeois outlook persisted  .  Cf Aikin ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01c.htm#3"}}{\fldrslt  [ 3 ]}}\'a0etc  .  The eighteenth century was the century of trade  .  Pinto says this expressly  :   "  Le commerce fait la marotte du si\'e8cle  "    ; and  :   "  Depuis quelque temps il n'est plus question que de commerce , de navgation et de marine  .   "    [   "  Commerce is the rage of the century  .   "     "  For some time now people have been talking only about commerce , navigation and the navy  .   "   - Ed  .  ]\
This period is also characterised by the cessation of the bans on the export of gold and silver and the beginning of the trade in money ; by banks , national debts , paper money ; by speculation in stocks and shares and stockjobbing in all articles ; by the development of finance in general  .  Again capital lost a great part of the natural character which had still clung to it  . \
 [ 4  .  Most Extensive Division of Labour  . \uc0\u8232 Large-Scale Industry ]\
The concentration of trade and manufacture in one country , England , developing irresistibly in the seventeenth century , gradually created for this country a relative world market , and thus a demand for the manufactured products of this country , which could no longer be met by the industrial productive forces hitherto existing  .  This demand , outgrowing the productive forces , was the motive power which , by producing big industry \'97 the application of elemental forces to industrial ends , machinery and the most complex division of labour \'97 called into existence the third period of private ownership since the Middle Ages  .  There already existed in England the other pre-conditions of this new phase  : freedom of competition inside the nation , the development of theoretical mechanics , etc  .  (  Indeed , the science of mechanics perfected by Newton was altogether the most popular science in France and England in the eighteenth century  .   ) (  Free competition inside the nation itself had everywhere to be conquered by a revolution \'97 1640 and 1688 in England , 1789 in France  .   )\
Competition soon compelled every country that wished to retain its historical role to protect its manufactures by renewed customs regulations (  the old duties were no longer any good against big industry  ) and soon after to introduce big industry under protective duties  .  Big industry universalised competition in spite of these protective measures (  it is practical free trade ; the protective duty is only a palliative , a measure of defence within free trade  ) , established means of communication and the modern world market , subordinated trade to itself , transformed all capital into industrial capital , and thus produced the rapid circulation (  development of the financial system  ) and the centralisation of capital  .  By universal competition it forced all individuals to strain their energy to the utmost  .  It destroyed as far as possible ideology , religion , morality , etc  .  and where it could not do this , made them into a palpable lie  .  It produced world history for the first time , insofar as it made all civilised nations and every individual member of them dependent for the satisfaction of their wants on the whole world , thus destroying the former natural exclusiveness of separate nations  .  It made natural science subservient to capital and took from the division of labour the last semblance of its natural character  .  It destroyed natural growth in general , as far as this is possible while labour exists , and resolved all natural relationships into money relationships  .  In the place of naturally grown towns it created the modern , large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight  .  Wherever it penetrated , it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry  .  It completed the victory of the commercial town over the countryside  .   [ Its first premise ] was the automatic system  .   [ Its development ] produced a mass of productive forces , for which private  [ property ] became just as much a fetter as the guild had been for manufacture and the small , rural workshop for the developing craft  .  These productive forces received under the system of private property a one-sided development only , and became for the majority destructive forces ; moreover , a great multitude of such forces could find no application at all within this system  .  Generally speaking , big industry created everywhere the same relations between the classes of society , and thus destroyed the peculiar individuality of the various nationalities  .  And finally , while the bourgeoisie of each nation still retained separate national interests , big industry created a class , which in all nations has the same interest and with which nationality is already dead ; a class which is really rid of all the old world and at the same time stands pitted against it  .  Big industry makes for the worker not only the relation to the capitalist , but labour itself , unbearable  . \
It is evident that big industry does not reach the same level of development in all districts of a country  .  This does not , however , retard the class movement of the proletariat , because the proletarians created by big industry assume leadership of this movement and carry the whole mass along with them , and because the workers excluded from big industry are placed by it in a still worse situation than the workers in big industry itself  .  The countries in which big industry is developed act in a similar manner upon the more or less non-industrial countries , insofar as the latter are swept by universal commerce into the universal competitive struggle  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01c.htm#4"}}{\fldrslt  [ 4 ]}}\
These different forms are just so many forms of the organisation of labour , and hence of property  .  In each period a unification of the existing productive forces takes place , insofar as this has been rendered necessary by needs  . \
\
The Relation of State and Law to Property\
The first form of property , in the ancient world as in the Middle Ages , is tribal property , determined with the Romans chiefly by war , with the Germans by the rearing of cattle  .  In the case of the ancient peoples , since several tribes live together in one town , the tribal property appears as State property , and the right of the individual to it as mere   "  possession  "   which , however , like tribal property as a whole , is confined to landed property only  .  Real private property began with the ancients , as with modern nations , with movable property  .  \'97 (  Slavery and community  ) (  dominium ex jure Quiritum\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01c.htm#5"}}{\fldrslt  [ 5 ]}}  )  .  In the case of the nations which grew out of the Middle Ages , tribal property evolved through various stages \'97 feudal landed property , corporative movable property , capital invested in manufacture \'97 to modern capital , determined by big industry and universal competition , i  . e  .  pure private property , which has cast off all semblance of a communal institution and has shut out the State from any influence on the development of property  .  To this modern private property corresponds the modern State , which , purchased gradually by the owners of property by means of taxation , has fallen entirely into their hands through the national debt , and its existence has become wholly dependent on the commercial credit which the owners of property , the bourgeois , extend to it , as reflected in the rise and fall of State funds on the stock exchange  .  By the mere fact that it is a class and no longer an estate , the bourgeoisie is forced to organise itself no longer locally , but nationally , and to give a general form to its mean average interest  .  Through the emancipation of private property from the community , the State has become a separate entity , beside and outside civil society ; but it is nothing more than the form of organisation which the bourgeois necessarily adopt both for internal and external purposes , for the mutual guarantee of their property and interests  .  The independence of the State is only found nowadays in those countries where the estates have not yet completely developed into classes , where the estates , done away with in more advanced countries , still have a part to play , and where there exists a mixture ; countries , that is to say , in which no one section of the population can achieve dominance over the others  .  This is the case particularly in Germany  .  The most perfect example of the modern State is North America  .  The modern French , English and American writers all express the opinion that the State exists only for the sake of private property , so that this fact has penetrated into the consciousness of the normal man  . \
Since the State is the form in which the individuals of a ruling class assert their common interests , and in which the whole civil society of an epoch is epitomised , it follows that the State mediates in the formation of all common institutions and that the institutions receive a political form  .  Hence the illusion that law is based on the will , and indeed on the will divorced from its real basis \'97 on free will  .  Similarly , justice is in its turn reduced to the actual laws  . \
Civil law develops simultaneously with private property out of the disintegration of the natural community  .  With the Romans the development of private property and civil law had no further industrial and commercial consequences , because their whole mode of production did not alter  .  (  Usury  !  )\
With modern peoples , where the feudal community was disintegrated by industry and trade , there began with the rise of private property and civil law a new phase , which was capable of further development  .  The very first town which carried on an extensive maritime trade in the Middle Ages , Amalfi , also developed maritime law  .  As soon as industry and trade developed private property further , first in Italy and later in other countries , the highly developed Roman civil law was immediately adopted again and raised , to authority  .  When later the bourgeoisie had acquired so much power that the princes took up its interests in order to overthrow the feudal nobility by means of the bourgeoisie , there began in all countries \'97 in France in the sixteenth century \'97 the real development of law , which in all countries except England proceeded on the basis of the Roman Codex  .  In England , too , Roman legal principles had to be introduced to further the development of civil law (  especially in the case of movable property  )  .  (  It must not be forgotten that law has just as little an independent history as religion  .   )\
In civil law the existing property relationships are declared to be the result of the general will  .  The\'a0jus utendi et abutendi\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01c.htm#6"}}{\fldrslt  [ 6 ]}}\'a0itself asserts on the one hand the fact that private property has become entirely independent of the community , and on the other the illusion that private property itself is based solely on the private will , the arbitrary disposal of the thing  .  In practice , the abuti has very definite economic limitations for the owner of private property , if he does not wish to see his property and hence his\'a0jus abutendi\'a0pass into other hands , since actually the thing , considered merely with reference to his will , is not a thing at all , but only becomes a thing , true property in intercourse , and independently of the law (  a relationship , which the philosophers call an idea  )  .  This juridical illusion , which reduces law to the mere will , necessarily leads , in the further development of property relationships , to the position that a man may have a legal title to a thing without really having the thing  .  If , for instance , the income from a piece of land is lost owing to competition , then the proprietor has certainly his legal title to it along with the\'a0jus utendi et abutendi  .  But he can do nothing with it  : he owns nothing as a landed proprietor if in addition he has not enough capital to cultivate his ground  .  This illusion of the jurists also explains the fact that for them , as for every code , it is altogether fortuitous that individuals enter into relationships among themselves (  e  . g  .  contracts  ) ; it explains why they consider that these relationships  [ can ] be entered into or not at will , and that their content rests purely on the individual  [ free ] will of the contracting parties  . \
Whenever , through the development of industry and commerce , new forms of intercourse have been evolved (  e  . g  .  assurance companies , etc  .   ) , the law has always been compelled to admit them among the modes of acquiring property  . \

Individuals , Class , and Community\
In the Middle Ages the citizens in each town were compelled to unite against the landed nobility to save their skins  .  The extension of trade , the establishment of communications , led the separate towns to get to know other towns , which had asserted the same interests in the struggle with the same antagonist  .  Out of the many local corporations of burghers there arose only gradually the burgher class  .  The conditions of life of the individual burghers became , on account of their contradiction to the existing relationships and of the mode of labour determined by these , conditions which were common to them all and independent of each individual  .  The burghers had created the conditions insofar as they had torn themselves free from feudal ties , and were created by them insofar as they were determined by their antagonism to the feudal system which they found in existence  .  When the individual towns began to enter into associations , these common conditions developed into class conditions  .  The same conditions , the same contradiction , the same interests necessarily called forth on the whole similar customs everywhere  .  The bourgeoisie itself with its conditions , develops only gradually , splits according to the division of labour into various fractions and finally absorbs all propertied classes it finds in existence\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\'a0(  while it develops the majority of the earlier propertyless and a part of the hitherto propertied classes into a new class , the proletariat  ) in the measure to which all property found in existence is transformed into industrial or commercial capital  .  The separate individuals form a class only insofar as they have to carry on a common battle against another class ; otherwise they are on hostile terms with each other as competitors  .  On the other hand , the class in its turn achieves an independent existence over against the individuals , so that the latter find their conditions of existence predestined , and hence have their position in life and their personal development assigned to them by their class , become subsumed under it  .  This is the same phenomenon as the subjection of the separate individuals to the division of labour and can only be removed by the abolition of private property and of labour itself  .  We have already indicated several times how this subsuming of individuals under the class brings with it their subjection to all kinds of ideas , etc  . \
If from a philosophical point of view one considers this evolution of individuals in the common conditions of existence of estates and classes , which followed on one another , and in the accompanying general conceptions forced upon them , it is certainly very easy to imagine that in these individuals the species , or   "  Man  "   , has evolved , or that they evolved   "  Man  "   \'97 and in this way one can give history some hard clouts on the ear  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt  [ 2 ]}}\'a0One can conceive these various estates and classes to be specific terms of the general expression , subordinate varieties of the species , or evolutionary phases of   "  Man  "    . \
This subsuming of individuals under definite classes cannot be abolished until a class has taken shape , which has no longer any particular class interest to assert against the ruling class  . \
The transformation , through the division of labour , of personal powers (  relationships  ) into material powers , cannot be dispelled by dismissing the general idea of it from one's mind , but can only be abolished by the individuals again subjecting these material powers to themselves and abolishing the division of labour  .  This is not possible without the community  .  Only in community  [ with others has each ] individual the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions ; only in the community , therefore , is personal freedom possible  .  In the previous substitutes for the community , in the State , etc  .  personal freedom has existed only for the individuals who developed within the relationships of the ruling class , and only insofar as they were individuals of this class  .  The illusory community , in which individuals have up till now combined , always took on an independent existence in relation to them , and was at the same time , since it was the combination of one class over against another , not only a completely illusory community , but a new fetter as well  .  In a real community the individuals obtain their freedom in and through their association  . \
Individuals have always built on themselves , but naturally on themselves within their given historical conditions and relationships , not on the   "  pure  "   individual in the sense of the ideologists  .  But in the course of historical evolution , and precisely through the inevitable fact that within the division of labour social relationships take on an independent existence , there appears a division within the life of each individual , insofar as it is personal and insofar as it is determined by some branch of labour and the conditions pertaining to it  .  (  We do not mean it to be understood from this that , for example , the rentier , the capitalist , etc  .  cease to be persons ; but their personality is conditioned and determined by quite definite class relationships , and the division appears only in their opposition to another class and , for themselves , only when they go bankrupt  .   ) In the estate (  and even more in the tribe  ) this is as yet concealed  : for instance , a nobleman always remains a nobleman , a commoner always a commoner , apart from his other relationships , a quality inseparable from his individuality  .  The division between the personal and the class individual , the accidental nature of the conditions of life for the individual , appears only with the emergence of the class , which is itself a product of the bourgeoisie  .  This accidental character is only engendered and developed by competition and the struggle of individuals among themselves  .  Thus , in imagination , individuals seem freer under the dominance of the bourgeoisie than before , because their conditions of life seem accidental ; in reality , of course , they are less free , because they are more subjected to the violence of things  .  The difference from the estate comes out particularly in the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat  .  When the estate of the urban burghers , the corporations , etc  .  emerged in opposition to the landed nobility , their condition of existence \'97 movable property and craft labour , which had already existed latently before their separation from the feudal ties \'97 appeared as something positive , which was asserted against feudal landed property , and , therefore , in its own way at first took on a feudal form  .  Certainly the refugee serfs treated their previous servitude as something accidental to their personality  .  But here they only were doing what every class that is freeing itself from a fetter does ; and they did not free themselves as a class but separately  .  Moreover , they did not rise above the system of estates , but only formed a new estate , retaining their previous mode of labour even in their new situation , and developing it further by freeing it from its earlier fetters , which no longer corresponded to the development already attained  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm#3"}}{\fldrslt  [ 3 ]}}\
For the proletarians , on the other hand , the condition of their existence , labour , and with it all the conditions of existence governing modern society , have become something accidental , something over which they , as separate individuals , have no control , and over which no social organisation can give them control  .  The contradiction between the individuality of each separate proletarian and labour , the condition of life forced upon him , becomes evident to him himself , for he is sacrificed from youth upwards and , within his own class , has no chance of arriving at the conditions which would place him in the other class  . \
\
Thus , while the refugee serfs only wished to be free to develop and assert those conditions of existence which were already there , and hence , in the end , only arrived at free labour , the proletarians , if they are to assert themselves as individuals , will have to abolish the very condition of their existence hitherto (  which has , moreover , been that of all society up to the present  ) , namely , labour  .  Thus they find themselves directly opposed to the form in which , hitherto , the individuals , of which society consists , have given themselves collective expression , that is , the State  .  In order , therefore , to assert themselves as individuals , they must overthrow the State  . \
It follows from all we have been saying up till now that the communal relationship into which the individuals of a class entered , and which was determined by their common interests over against a third party , was always a community to which these individuals belonged only as average individuals , only insofar as they lived within the conditions of existence of their class \'97 a relationship in which they participated not as individuals but as members of a class  .  With the community of revolutionary proletarians , on the other hand , who take their conditions of existence and those of all members of society under their control , it is just the reverse ; it is as individuals that the individuals participate in it  .  It is just this combination of individuals (  assuming the advanced stage of modern productive forces , of course  ) which puts the conditions of the free development and movement of individuals under their control \'97 conditions which were previously abandoned to chance and had won an independent existence over against the separate individuals just because of their separation as individuals , and because of the necessity of their combination which had been determined by the division of labour , and through their separation had become a bond alien to them  .  Combination up till now (  by no means an arbitrary one , such as is expounded for example in the\'a0Contrat social , but a necessary one  ) was an agreement upon these conditions , within which the individuals were free to enjoy the freaks of fortune (  compare , e  . g  .  , the formation of the North American State and the South American republics  )  .  This right to the undisturbed enjoyment , within certain conditions , of fortuity and chance has up till now been called personal freedom  .  These conditions of existence are , of course , only the productive forces and forms of intercourse at any particular time  . \
Forms of Intercourse\
Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse , and for the first time consciously treats all natural premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men , strips them of their natural character and subjugates them to the power of the united individuals  .  Its organisation is , therefore , essentially economic , the material production of the conditions of this unity ; it turns existing conditions into conditions of unity  .  The reality , which communism is creating , is precisely the true basis for rendering it impossible that anything should exist independently of individuals , insofar as reality is only a product of the preceding intercourse of individuals themselves  .  Thus the communists in practice treat the conditions created up to now by production and intercourse as inorganic conditions , without , however , imagining that it was the plan or the destiny of previous generations to give them material , and without believing that these conditions were inorganic for the individuals creating them  . \
Contradiction between individuals and their conditions of life as contradiction between productive forces and the form of intercourse\
The difference between the individual as a person and what is accidental to him , is not a conceptual difference but an historical fact  .  This distinction has a different significance at different times \'97 e  . g  .  the estate as something accidental to the individual in the eighteenth century , the family more or less too  .  It is not a distinction that we have to make for each age , but one which each age makes itself from among the different elements which it finds in existence , and indeed not according to any theory , but compelled by material collisions in life  . \
What appears accidental to the later age as opposed to the earlier \'97 and this applies also to the elements handed down by an earlier age \'97 is a form of intercourse which corresponded to a definite stage of development of the productive forces  .  The relation of the productive forces to the form of intercourse is the relation of the form of intercourse to the occupation or activity of the individuals  .  (  The fundamental form of this activity is , of course , material , on which depend all other forms - mental , political , religious , etc  .  The various shaping of material life is , of course , in every case dependent on the needs which are already developed , and the production , as well as the satisfaction , of these needs is an historical process , which is not found in the case of a sheep or a dog (  Stirner's refractory principal argument\'a0adversus hominem  ) , although sheep and dogs in their present form certainly , but\'a0malgr\'e9 eux ,\'a0are products of an historical process  .   ) The conditions under which individuals have intercourse with each other , so long as the above-mentioned contradiction is absent , are conditions appertaining to their individuality , in no way external to them ; conditions under which these definite individuals , living under definite relationships , can alone produce their material life and what is connected with it , are thus the conditions of their self-activity and are produced by this self-activity  .  The definite condition under which they produce , thus corresponds , as long as the contradiction has not yet appeared , to the reality of their conditioned nature , their one-sided existence , the one-sidedness of which only becomes evident when the contradiction enters on the scene and thus exists for the later individuals  .  Then this condition appears as an accidental fetter , and the consciousness that it is a fetter is imputed to the earlier age as well  . \
These various conditions , which appear first as conditions of self-activity , later as fetters upon it , form in the whole evolution of history a coherent series of forms of intercourse , the coherence of which consists in this  : in the place of an earlier form of intercourse , which has become a fetter , a new one is put , corresponding to the more developed productive forces and , hence , to the advanced mode of the self-activity of individuals - a form which in its turn becomes a fetter and is then replaced by another  .  Since these conditions correspond at every stage to the simultaneous development of the productive forces , their history is at the same time the history of the evolving productive forces taken over by each new generation , and is , therefore , the history of the development of the forces of the individuals themselves  . \
Since this evolution takes place naturally , i  . e  .  is not subordinated to a general plan of freely combined individuals , it proceeds from various localities , tribes , nations , branches of labour , etc  .  each of which to start with develops independently of the others and only gradually enters into relation with the others  .  Furthermore , it takes place only very slowly ; the various stages and interests are never completely overcome , but only subordinated to the prevailing interest and trail along beside the latter for centuries afterwards  .  It follows from this that within a nation itself the individuals , even apart from their pecuniary circumstances , have quite different developments , and that an earlier interest , the peculiar form of intercourse of which has already been ousted by that belonging to a later interest , remains for a long time afterwards in possession of a traditional power in the illusory community (  State , law  ) , which has won an existence independent of the individuals ; a power which in the last resort can only be broken by a revolution  .  This explains why , with reference to individual points which allow of a more general summing-up , consciousness can sometimes appear further advanced than the contemporary empirical relationships , so that in the struggles of a later epoch one can refer to earlier theoreticians as authorities  . \
On the other hand , in countries which , like North America , begin in an already advanced historical epoch , the development proceeds very rapidly  .  Such countries have no other natural premises than the individuals , who settled there and were led to do so because the forms of intercourse of the old countries did not correspond to their wants  .  Thus they begin with the most advanced individuals of the old countries , and , therefore , with the correspondingly most advanced form of intercourse , before this form of intercourse has been able to establish itself in the old countries  .  This is the case with all colonies , insofar as they are not mere military or trading stations  .  Carthage , the Greek colonies , and Iceland in the eleventh and twelfth centuries , provide examples of this  .  A similar relationship issues from conquest , when a form of intercourse which has evolved on another soil is brought over complete to the conquered country  : whereas in its home it was still encumbered with interests and relationships left over from earlier periods , here it can and must be established completely and without hindrance , if only to assure the conquerors' lasting power  .  (  England and Naples after the Norman conquest , when they received the most perfect form of feudal organisation  .   )\
\
 [ 5  .  The Contradiction Between the Productive Forces and the Form of Intercourse as the Basis for Social Revolution ]\
This contradiction between the productive forces and the form of intercourse , which , as we saw , has occurred several times in past history , without , however , endangering the basis , necessarily on each occasion burst out in a revolution , taking on at the same time various subsidiary forms , such as all-embracing collisions , collisions of various classes , contradiction of consciousness , battle of ideas , etc  .  , political conflict , etc  .  From a narrow point of view one may isolate one of these subsidiary forms and consider it as the basis of these revolutions ; and this is all the more easy as the individuals who started the revolutions had illusions about their own activity according to their degree of culture and the stage of historical development  . \
Thus all collisions in history have their origin , according to our view , in the contradiction between the productive forces and the form of intercourse  .  Incidentally , to lead to collisions in a country , this contradiction need not necessarily have reached its extreme limit in this particular country  .  The competition with industrially more advanced countries , brought about by the expansion of international intercourse , is sufficient to produce a similar contradiction in countries with a backward industry (  e  . g  .  the latent proletariat in Germany brought into view by view by the competition of English industry  )  . \
\
Conquest\
This whole interpretation of history appears to be contradicted by the fact of conquest  .  Up till now violence , war , pillage , murder and robbery , etc  .  have been accepted as the driving force of history  .  Here we must limit ourselves to the chief points and take , therefore , only the most striking example \'97 the destruction of an old civilisation by a barbarous people and the resulting formation of an entirely new organisation of society  .  (  Rome and the barbarians ; feudalism and Gaul ; the Byzantine Empire and the Turks  .   )\
With the conquering barbarian people war itself is still , as indicated above , a regular form of intercourse , which is the more eagerly exploited as the increase in population together with the traditional and , for it , the only possible , crude mode of production gives rise to the need for new means of production  .  In Italy , on the other hand , the concentration of landed property (  caused not only by buying-up and indebtedness but also by inheritance , since loose living being rife and marriage rare , the old families gradually died out and their possessions fell into the hands of a few  ) and its conversion into grazing land (  caused not only by the usual economic forces still operative today but by the importation of plundered and tribute-corn and the resultant lack of demand for Italian corn  ) brought about the almost total disappearance of the free population  .  The very slaves died out again and again , and had constantly to be replaced by new ones  .  Slavery remained the basis of the whole productive system  .  The plebeians , midway between freemen and slaves , never succeeded in becoming more than a proletarian rabble  .  Rome indeed never became more than a city ; its connection with the provinces was almost exclusively political and could , therefore , easily be broken again by political events  . \
Nothing is more common than the notion that in history up till now it has only been a question of taking  .  The barbarians take the Roman Empire , and this fact of taking is made to explain the transition from the old world to the feudal system  .  In this taking by barbarians , however , the question is , whether the nation which is conquered has evolved industrial productive forces , as is the case with modern peoples , or whether their productive forces are based for the most part merely on their association and on the community  .  Taking is further determined by the object taken  .  A banker's fortune , consisting of paper , cannot be taken at all , without the taker's submitting to the conditions of production and intercourse of the country taken  .  Similarly the total industrial capital of a modern industrial country  .  And finally , everywhere there is very soon an end to taking , and when there is nothing more to take , you have to set about producing  .  From this necessity of producing , which very soon asserts itself , it follows that the form of community adopted by the settling conquerors must correspond to the stage of development of the productive forces they find in existence ; or , if this is not the case from the start , it must change according to the productive forces  .  By this , too , is explained the fact , which people profess to have noticed everywhere in the period following the migration of the peoples , namely , that the servant was master , and that the conquerors very soon took over language , culture and manners from the conquered  .  The feudal system was by no means brought complete from Germany , but had its origin , as far as the conquerors were concerned , in the martial organisation of the army during the actual conquest , and this only evolved after the conquest into the feudal system proper through the action of the productive forces found in the conquered countries  .  To what an extent this form was determined by the productive forces is shown by the abortive attempts to realise other forms derived from reminiscences of ancient Rome (  Charlemagne , etc  .   )  . \
\
Contradictions of Big Industry  : Revolution\
Our investigation hitherto started from the instruments of production , and it has already shown that private property was a necessity for certain industrial stages  .  In\'a0industrie extractive\'a0private property still coincides with labour ; in small industry and all agriculture up till now property is the necessary consequence of the existing instruments of production ; in big industry the contradiction between the instrument of production and private property appears from the first time and is the product of big industry ; moreover , big industry must be highly developed to produce this contradiction  .  And thus only with big industry does the abolition of private property become possible  . \
 [ 9  .  Contradiction Between the Productive Forces and the Form of Intercourse ]\
In big industry and competition the whole mass of conditions of existence , limitations , biases of individuals , are fused together into the two simplest forms  : private property and labour  .  With money every form of intercourse , and intercourse itself , is considered fortuitous for the individuals  .  Thus money implies that all previous intercourse was only intercourse of individuals under particular conditions , not of individuals as individuals  .  These conditions are reduced to two  : accumulated labour or private property , and actual labour  .  If both or one of these ceases , then intercourse comes to a standstill  .  The modern economists themselves , e  . g  .  Sismondi , Cherbuliez , etc  .  , oppose   "  association of individuals  "   to   "  association of capital  .   "   On the other hand , the individuals themselves are entirely subordinated to the division of labour and hence are brought into the most complete dependence on one another  .  Private property , insofar as within labour itself it is opposed to labour , evolves out of the necessity of accumulation , and has still , to begin with , rather the form of the communality ; but in its further development it approaches more and more the modern form of private property  .  The division of labour implies from the outset the division of the conditions of labour , of tools and materials , and thus the splitting-up of accumulated capital among different owners , and thus , also , the division between capital and labour , and the different forms of property itself  .  The more the division of labour develops and accumulation grows , the sharper are the forms that this process of differentiation assumes  .  Labour itself can only exist on the premise of this fragmentation  . \
\
Thus two facts are here revealed  .  First the productive forces appear as a world for themselves , quite independent of and divorced from the individuals , alongside the individuals  : the reason for this is that the individuals , whose forces they are , exist split up and in opposition to one another , whilst , on the other hand , these forces are only real forces in the intercourse and association of these individuals  .  Thus , on the one hand , we have a totality of productive forces , which have , as it were , taken on a material form and are for the individuals no longer the forces of the individuals but of private property , and hence of the individuals only insofar as they are owners of private property themselves  .  Never , in any earlier period , have the productive forces taken on a form so indifferent to the intercourse of individuals as individuals , because their intercourse itself was formerly a restricted one  .  On the other hand , standing over against these productive forces , we have the majority of the individuals from whom these forces have been wrested away , and who , robbed thus of all real life-content , have become abstract individuals , but who are , however , only by this fact put into a position to enter into relation with one another\'a0as individuals  . \
The only connection which still links them with the productive forces and with their own existence \'97 labour \'97 has lost all semblance of self-activity and only sustains their life by stunting it  .  While in the earlier periods self-activity and the production of material life were separated , in that they devolved on different persons , and while , on account of the narrowness of the individuals themselves , the production of material life was considered as a subordinate mode of self-activity , they now diverge to such an extent that altogether material life appears as the end , and what produces this material life , labour (  which is now the only possible but , as we see , negative form of self-activity  ) , as the means  . \
 [ 10  .  The Necessity , Preconditions and Consequences of the Abolition of Private Property ]\
Thus things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces , not only to achieve self-activity , but , also , merely to safeguard their very existence  .  This appropriation is first determined by the object to be appropriated , the productive forces , which have been developed to a totality and which only exist within a universal intercourse  .  From this aspect alone , therefore , this appropriation must have a universal character corresponding to the productive forces and the intercourse  . \
The appropriation of these forces is itself nothing more than the development of the individual capacities corresponding to the material instruments of production  .  The appropriation of a totality of instruments of production is , for this very reason , the development of a totality of capacities in the individuals themselves  . \
This appropriation is further determined by the persons appropriating  .  Only the proletarians of the present day , who are completely shut off from all self-activity , are in a position to achieve a complete and no longer restricted self-activity , which consists in the appropriation of a totality of productive forces and in the thus postulated development of a totality of capacities  .  All earlier revolutionary appropriations were restricted ; individuals , whose self-activity was restricted by a crude instrument of production and a limited intercourse , appropriated this crude instrument of production , and hence merely achieved a new state of limitation  .  Their instrument of production became their property , but they themselves remained subordinate to the division of labour and their own instrument of production  .  In all expropriations up to now , a mass of individuals remained subservient to a single instrument of production ; in the appropriation by the proletarians , a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual , and property to all  .  Modern universal intercourse can be controlled by individuals , therefore , only when controlled by all  . \
This appropriation is further determined by the manner in which it must be effected  .  It can only be effected through a union , which by the character of the proletariat itself can again only be a universal one , and through a revolution , in which , on the one hand , the power of the earlier mode of production and intercourse and social organisation is overthrown , and , on the other hand , there develops the universal character and the energy of the proletariat , without which the revolution cannot be accomplished ; and in which , further , the proletariat rids itself of everything that still clings to it from its previous position in society  . \
Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life , which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations  .  The transformation of labour into self-activity corresponds to the transformation of the earlier limited intercourse into the intercourse of individuals as such  .  With the appropriation of the total productive forces through united individuals , private property comes to an end  .  Whilst previously in history a particular condition always appeared as accidental , now the isolation of individuals and the particular private gain of each man have themselves become accidental  . \
The individuals , who are no longer subject to the division of labour , have been conceived by the philosophers as an ideal , under the name   "  Man  "    .  They have conceived the whole process which we have outlined as the evolutionary process of   "  Man ,  "   so that at every historical stage   "  Man  "   was substituted for the individuals and shown as the motive force of history  .  The whole process was thus conceived as a process of the self-estrangement of   "  Man ,  "   and this was essentially due to the fact that the average individual of the later stage was always foisted on to the earlier stage , and the consciousness of a later age on to the individuals of an earlier  .  Through this inversion , which from the first is an abstract image of the actual conditions , it was possible to transform the whole of history into an evolutionary process of consciousness  . \
\
The Necessity of the Communist Revolution\
Finally , from the conception of history we have sketched we obtain these further conclusions  :\
(  1  )\'a0In the development of productive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being , which , under the existing relationships , only cause mischief , and are no longer productive but destructive forces (  machinery and money  ) ; and connected with this a class is called forth , which has to bear all the burdens of society without enjoying its advantages , which , ousted from society , is forced into the most decided antagonism to all other classes ; a class which forms the majority of all members of society , and from which emanates the consciousness of the necessity of a fundamental revolution , the communist consciousness , which may , of course , arise among the other classes too through the contemplation of the situation of this class  . \
(  2  )\'a0The conditions under which definite productive forces can be applied are the conditions of the rule of a definite class of society , whose social power , deriving from its property , has its practical-idealistic expression in each case in the form of the State ; and , therefore , every revolutionary struggle is directed against a class , which till then has been in power  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm#4"}}{\fldrslt  [ 4 ]}}\
(  3  )\'a0In all revolutions up till now the mode of activity always remained unscathed and it was only a question of a different distribution of this activity , a new distribution of labour to other persons , whilst the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity , does away with labour , and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves , because it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society , is not recognised as a class , and is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes , nationalities , etc  .  within present society ; and\
(  4  )\'a0Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness , and for the success of the cause itself , the alteration of men on a mass scale is , necessary , an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement , a revolution ; this revolution is necessary , therefore , not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way , but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew  . \
\
\'97 1 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What is Communism  ?\
Communism is the doctrine of the conditions of the liberation of the proletariat  . \
\
\
\'97 2 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What is the proletariat  ?\
The proletariat is that class in society which lives entirely from the sale of its labor and does not draw profit from any kind of capital ; whose weal and woe , whose life and death , whose sole existence depends on the demand for labor \'96 hence , on the changing state of business , on the vagaries of unbridled competition  .  The proletariat , or the class of proletarians , is , in a word , the working class of the 19th century  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm#nb"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\
\
\
\'97 3 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 Proletarians , then , have not always existed  ?\
No  .  There have always been poor and working classes ; and the working class have mostly been poor  .  But there have not always been workers and poor people living under conditions as they are today ; in other words , there have not always been proletarians , any more than there has always been free unbridled competitions  . \
\
\
\'97 4 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 How did the proletariat originate  ?\
The Proletariat originated in the industrial revolution , which took place in England in the last half of the last (  18th  ) century , and which has since then been repeated in all the civilized countries of the world  . \
This industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam engine , various spinning machines , the mechanical loom , and a whole series of other mechanical devices  .  These machines , which were very expensive and hence could be bought only by big capitalists , altered the whole mode of production and displaced the former workers , because the machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers could produce with their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms  .  The machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the big capitalists and rendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the workers (  tools , looms , etc  .   )  .  The result was that the capitalists soon had everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers  .  This marked the introduction of the factory system into the textile industry  . \
Once the impulse to the introduction of machinery and the factory system had been given , this system spread quickly to all other branches of industry , especially cloth- and book-printing , pottery , and the metal industries  . \
Labor was more and more divided among the individual workers so that the worker who previously had done a complete piece of work now did only a part of that piece  .  This division of labor made it possible to produce things faster and cheaper  .  It reduced the activity of the individual worker to simple , endlessly repeated mechanical motions which could be performed not only as well but much better by a machine  .  In this way , all these industries fell , one after another , under the dominance of steam , machinery , and the factory system , just as spinning and weaving had already done  . \
But at the same time , they also fell into the hands of big capitalists , and their workers were deprived of whatever independence remained to them  .  Gradually , not only genuine manufacture but also handicrafts came within the province of the factory system as big capitalists increasingly displaced the small master craftsmen by setting up huge workshops , which saved many expenses and permitted an elaborate division of labor  . \
This is how it has come about that in civilized countries at the present time nearly all kinds of labor are performed in factories \'96 and , in nearly all branches of work , handicrafts and manufacture have been superseded  .  This process has , to an ever greater degree , ruined the old middle class , especially the small handicraftsmen ; it has entirely transformed the condition of the workers ; and two new classes have been created which are gradually swallowing up all the others  .  These are  :\
(  i  ) The class of big capitalists , who , in all civilized countries , are already in almost exclusive possession of all the means of subsistance and of the instruments (  machines , factories  ) and materials necessary for the production of the means of subsistence  .  This is the bourgeois class , or the bourgeoisie  . \
(  ii  ) The class of the wholly propertyless , who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order to get , in exchange , the means of subsistence for their support  .  This is called the class of proletarians , or the proletariat  . \
\
\
\'97 5 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 Under what conditions does this sale of the\u8232 labor of the proletarians to the bourgeoisie take place  ?\
Labor is a commodity , like any other , and its price is therefore determined by exactly the same laws that apply to other commodities  .  In a regime of big industry or of free competition \'96 as we shall see , the two come to the same thing \'96 the price of a commodity is , on the average , always equal to its cost of production  .  Hence , the price of labor is also equal to the cost of production of labor  . \
But , the costs of production of labor consist of precisely the quantity of means of subsistence necessary to enable the worker to continue working , and to prevent the working class from dying out  .  The worker will therefore get no more for his labor than is necessary for this purpose ; the price of labor , or the wage , will , in other words , be the lowest , the minimum , required for the maintenance of life  . \
However , since business is sometimes better and sometimes worse , it follows that the worker sometimes gets more and sometimes gets less for his commodities  .  But , again , just as the industrialist , on the average of good times and bad , gets no more and no less for his commodities than what they cost , similarly on the average the worker gets no more and no less than his minimum  . \
This economic law of wages operates the more strictly the greater the degree to which big industry has taken possession of all branches of production  . \
\
\
\'97 6 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What working classes were there before the industrial revolution  ?\
The working classes have always , according to the different stages of development of society , lived in different circumstances and had different relations to the owning and ruling classes  . \
In antiquity , the workers were the slaves of the owners , just as they still are in many backward countries and even in the southern part of the United States  . \
In the Middle Ages , they were the serfs of the land-owning nobility , as they still are in Hungary , Poland , and Russia  .  In the Middle Ages , and indeed right up to the industrial revolution , there were also journeymen in the cities who worked in the service of petty bourgeois masters  .  Gradually , as manufacture developed , these journeymen became manufacturing workers who were even then employed by larger capitalists  . \
\
\
\'97 7 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 In what way do proletarians differ from slaves  ?\
The slave is sold once and for all ; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly  . \
The individual slave , property of one master , is assured an existence , however miserable it may be , because of the master\'92s interest  .  The individual proletarian , property as it were of the entire bourgeois class which buys his labor only when someone has need of it , has no secure existence  .  This existence is assured only to the class as a whole  . \
The slave is outside competition ; the proletarian is in it and experiences all its vagaries  . \
The slave counts as a thing , not as a member of society  .  Thus , the slave can have a better existence than the proletarian , while the proletarian belongs to a higher stage of social development and , himself , stands on a higher social level than the slave  . \
The slave frees himself when , of all the relations of private property , he abolishes only the relation of slavery and thereby becomes a proletarian ; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general  . \
\
\
\'97 8 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 In what way do proletarians differ from serfs  ?\
The serf possesses and uses an instrument of production , a piece of land , in exchange for which he gives up a part of his product or part of the services of his labor  . \
The proletarian works with the instruments of production of another , for the account of this other , in exchange for a part of the product  . \
The serf gives up , the proletarian receives  .  The serf has an assured existence , the proletarian has not  .  The serf is outside competition , the proletarian is in it  . \
The serf liberates himself in one of three ways  : either he runs away to the city and there becomes a handicraftsman ; or , instead of products and services , he gives money to his lord and thereby becomes a free tenant ; or he overthrows his feudal lord and himself becomes a property owner  .  In short , by one route or another , he gets into the owning class and enters into competition  .  The proletarian liberates himself by abolishing competition , private property , and all class differences  . \
\
\
\'97 9 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 In what way do proletarians differ from handicraftsmen  ?\
In contrast to the proletarian , the so-called handicraftsman , as he still existed almost everywhere in the past (  eighteenth  ) century and still exists here and there at present , is a proletarian at most temporarily  .  His goal is to acquire capital himself wherewith to exploit other workers  .  He can often achieve this goal where guilds still exist or where freedom from guild restrictions has not yet led to the introduction of factory-style methods into the crafts nor yet to fierce competition But as soon as the factory system has been introduced into the crafts and competition flourishes fully , this perspective dwindles away and the handicraftsman becomes more and more a proletarian  .  The handicraftsman therefore frees himself by becoming either bourgeois or entering the middle class in general , or becoming a proletarian because of competition (  as is now more often the case  )  .  In which case he can free himself by joining the proletarian movement , i  . e  .  , the more or less communist movement  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm#nc"}}{\fldrslt  [ 2 ]}}\
\
\
\'97 10 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 In what way do proletarians differ from manufacturing workers  ?\
The manufacturing worker of the 16th to the 18th centuries still had , with but few exception , an instrument of production in his own possession \'96 his loom , the family spinning wheel , a little plot of land which he cultivated in his spare time  .  The proletarian has none of these things  . \
The manufacturing worker almost always lives in the countryside and in a more or less patriarchal relation to his landlord or employer ; the proletarian lives , for the most part , in the city and his relation to his employer is purely a cash relation  . \
The manufacturing worker is torn out of his patriarchal relation by big industry , loses whatever property he still has , and in this way becomes a proletarian  . \
\
\
\'97 11 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What were the immediate consequences of the industrial revolution and of the division of society into bourgeoisie and proletariat  ?\
First , the lower and lower prices of industrial products brought about by machine labor totally destroyed , in all countries of the world , the old system of manufacture or industry based upon hand labor  . \
In this way , all semi-barbarian countries , which had hitherto been more or less strangers to historical development , and whose industry had been based on manufacture , were violently forced out of their isolation  .  They bought the cheaper commodities of the English and allowed their own manufacturing workers to be ruined  .  Countries which had known no progress for thousands of years \'96 for example , India \'96 were thoroughly revolutionized , and even China is now on the way to a revolution  . \
We have come to the point where a new machine invented in England deprives millions of Chinese workers of their livelihood within a year\'92s time  . \
In this way , big industry has brought all the people of the Earth into contact with each other , has merged all local markets into one world market , has spread civilization and progress everywhere and has thus ensured that whatever happens in civilized countries will have repercussions in all other countries  . \
It follows that if the workers in England or France now liberate themselves , this must set off revolution in all other countries \'96 revolutions which , sooner or later , must accomplish the liberation of their respective working class  . \
Second , wherever big industries displaced manufacture , the bourgeoisie developed in wealth and power to the utmost and made itself the first class of the country  .  The result was that wherever this happened , the bourgeoisie took political power into its own hands and displaced the hitherto ruling classes , the aristocracy , the guildmasters , and their representative , the absolute monarchy  . \
The bourgeoisie annihilated the power of the aristocracy , the nobility , by abolishing the entailment of estates \'96 in other words , by making landed property subject to purchase and sale , and by doing away with the special privileges of the nobility  .  It destroyed the power of the guildmasters by abolishing guilds and handicraft privileges  .  In their place , it put competition \'96 that is , a state of society in which everyone has the right to enter into any branch of industry , the only obstacle being a lack of the necessary capital  . \
The introduction of free competition is thus public declaration that from now on the members of society are unequal only to the extent that their capitals are unequal , that capital is the decisive power , and that therefore the capitalists , the bourgeoisie , have become the first class in society  . \
Free competition is necessary for the establishment of big industry , because it is the only condition of society in which big industry can make its way  . \
Having destroyed the social power of the nobility and the guildmasters , the bourgeois also destroyed their political power  .  Having raised itself to the actual position of first class in society , it proclaims itself to be also the dominant political class  .  This it does through the introduction of the representative system which rests on bourgeois equality before the law and the recognition of free competition , and in European countries takes the form of constitutional monarchy  .  In these constitutional monarchies , only those who possess a certain capital are voters \'96 that is to say , only members of the bourgeoisie  .  These bourgeois voters choose the deputies , and these bourgeois deputies , by using their right to refuse to vote taxes , choose a bourgeois government  . \
Third , everywhere the proletariat develops in step with the bourgeoisie  .  In proportion , as the bourgeoisie grows in wealth , the proletariat grows in numbers  .  For , since the proletarians can be employed only by capital , and since capital extends only through employing labor , it follows that the growth of the proletariat proceeds at precisely the same pace as the growth of capital  . \
Simultaneously , this process draws members of the bourgeoisie and proletarians together into the great cities where industry can be carried on most profitably , and by thus throwing great masses in one spot it gives to the proletarians a consciousness of their own strength  . \
Moreover , the further this process advances , the more new labor-saving machines are invented , the greater is the pressure exercised by big industry on wages , which , as we have seen , sink to their minimum and therewith render the condition of the proletariat increasingly unbearable  .  The growing dissatisfaction of the proletariat thus joins with its rising power to prepare a proletarian social revolution  . \
\
\
\'97 12 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What were the further consequences of the industrial revolution  ?\
Big industry created in the steam engine , and other machines , the means of endlessly expanding industrial production , speeding it up , and cutting its costs  .  With production thus facilitated , the free competition , which is necessarily bound up with big industry , assumed the most extreme forms ; a multitude of capitalists invaded industry , and , in a short while , more was produced than was needed  . \
As a consequence , finished commodities could not be sold , and a so-called commercial crisis broke out  .  Factories had to be closed , their owners went bankrupt , and the workers were without bread  .  Deepest misery reigned everywhere  . \
After a time , the superfluous products were sold , the factories began to operate again , wages rose , and gradually business got better than ever  . \
But it was not long before too many commodities were again produced and a new crisis broke out , only to follow the same course as its predecessor  . \
Ever since the beginning of this (  19th  ) century , the condition of industry has constantly fluctuated between periods of prosperity and periods of crisis ; nearly every five to seven years , a fresh crisis has intervened , always with the greatest hardship for workers , and always accompanied by general revolutionary stirrings and the direct peril to the whole existing order of things  . \
\
\
\'97 13 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What follows from these periodic commercial crises  ?\
First  :\
That , though big industry in its earliest stage created free competition , it has now outgrown free competition ;\
that , for big industry , competition and generally the individualistic organization of production have become a fetter which it must and will shatter ;\
that , so long as big industry remains on its present footing , it can be maintained only at the cost of general chaos every seven years , each time threatening the whole of civilization and not only plunging the proletarians into misery but also ruining large sections of the bourgeoisie ;\
hence , either that big industry must itself be given up , which is an absolute impossibility , or that it makes unavoidably necessary an entirely new organization of society in which production is no longer directed by mutually competing individual industrialists but rather by the whole society operating according to a definite plan and taking account of the needs of all  . \
Second  : That big industry , and the limitless expansion of production which it makes possible , bring within the range of feasibility a social order in which so much is produced that every member of society will be in a position to exercise and develop all his powers and faculties in complete freedom  . \
It thus appears that the very qualities of big industry which , in our present-day society , produce misery and crises are those which , in a different form of society , will abolish this misery and these catastrophic depressions  . \
We see with the greatest clarity  :\
(  i  ) That all these evils are from now on to be ascribed solely to a social order which no longer corresponds to the requirements of the real situation ; and\
(  ii  ) That it is possible , through a new social order , to do away with these evils altogether  . \
\
\
\'97 14 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What will this new social order have to be like  ?\
Above all , it will have to take the control of industry and of all branches of production out of the hands of mutually competing individuals , and instead institute a system in which all these branches of production are operated by society as a whole \'96 that is , for the common account , according to a common plan , and with the participation of all members of society  . \
It will , in other words , abolish competition and replace it with association  . \
Moreover , since the management of industry by individuals necessarily implies private property , and since competition is in reality merely the manner and form in which the control of industry by private property owners expresses itself , it follows that private property cannot be separated from competition and the individual management of industry  .  Private property must , therefore , be abolished and in its place must come the common utilization of all instruments of production and the distribution of all products according to common agreement \'96 in a word , what is called the communal ownership of goods  . \
In fact , the abolition of private property is , doubtless , the shortest and most significant way to characterize the revolution in the whole social order which has been made necessary by the development of industry \'96 and for this reason it is rightly advanced by communists as their main demand  . \
\
\
\'97 15 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 Was not the abolition of private property possible at an earlier time  ?\
No  .  Every change in the social order , every revolution in property relations , is the necessary consequence of the creation of new forces of production which no longer fit into the old property relations  . \
Private property has not always existed  . \
When , towards the end of the Middle Ages , there arose a new mode of production which could not be carried on under the then existing feudal and guild forms of property , this manufacture , which had outgrown the old property relations , created a new property form , private property  .  And for manufacture and the earliest stage of development of big industry , private property was the only possible property form ; the social order based on it was the only possible social order  . \
So long as it is not possible to produce so much that there is enough for all , with more left over for expanding the social capital and extending the forces of production \'96 so long as this is not possible , there must always be a ruling class directing the use of society\'92s productive forces , and a poor , oppressed class  .  How these classes are constituted depends on the stage of development  . \
The agrarian Middle Ages give us the baron and the serf ; the cities of the later Middle Ages show us the guildmaster and the journeyman and the day laborer ; the 17th century has its manufacturing workers ; the 19th has big factory owners and proletarians  . \
It is clear that , up to now , the forces of production have never been developed to the point where enough could be developed for all , and that private property has become a fetter and a barrier in relation to the further development of the forces of production  . \
Now , however , the development of big industry has ushered in a new period  .  Capital and the forces of production have been expanded to an unprecedented extent , and the means are at hand to multiply them without limit in the near future  .  Moreover , the forces of production have been concentrated in the hands of a few bourgeois , while the great mass of the people are more and more falling into the proletariat , their situation becoming more wretched and intolerable in proportion to the increase of wealth of the bourgeoisie  .  And finally , these mighty and easily extended forces of production have so far outgrown private property and the bourgeoisie , that they threaten at any moment to unleash the most violent disturbances of the social order  .  Now , under these conditions , the abolition of private property has become not only possible but absolutely necessary  . \
\
\
\'97 16 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 Will the peaceful abolition of private property be possible  ?\
It would be desirable if this could happen , and the communists would certainly be the last to oppose it  .  Communists know only too well that all conspiracies are not only useless , but even harmful  .  They know all too well that revolutions are not made intentionally and arbitrarily , but that , everywhere and always , they have been the necessary consequence of conditions which were wholly independent of the will and direction of individual parties and entire classes  . \
But they also see that the development of the proletariat in nearly all civilized countries has been violently suppressed , and that in this way the opponents of communism have been working toward a revolution with all their strength  .  If the oppressed proletariat is finally driven to revolution , then we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them with words  . \
\
\
\'97 17 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 Will it be possible for private property to be abolished at one stroke  ?\
No , no more than existing forces of production can at one stroke be multiplied to the extent necessary for the creation of a communal society  . \
In all probability , the proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity  . \
\
\
\'97 18 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What will be the course of this revolution  ?\
Above all , it will establish a democratic constitution , and through this , the direct or indirect dominance of the proletariat  .  Direct in England , where the proletarians are already a majority of the people  .  Indirect in France and Germany , where the majority of the people consists not only of proletarians , but also of small peasants and petty bourgeois who are in the process of falling into the proletariat , who are more and more dependent in all their political interests on the proletariat , and who must , therefore , soon adapt to the demands of the proletariat  .  Perhaps this will cost a second struggle , but the outcome can only be the victory of the proletariat  . \
Democracy would be wholly valueless to the proletariat if it were not immediately used as a means for putting through measures directed against private property and ensuring the livelihood of the proletariat  .  The main measures , emerging as the necessary result of existing relations , are the following  :\
(  i  ) Limitation of private property through progressive taxation , heavy inheritance taxes , abolition of inheritance through collateral lines (  brothers , nephews , etc  .   ) forced loans , etc  . \
(  ii  ) Gradual expropriation of landowners , industrialists , railroad magnates and shipowners , partly through competition by state industry , partly directly through compensation in the form of bonds  . \
(  iii  ) Confiscation of the possessions of all emigrants and rebels against the majority of the people  . \
(  iv  ) Organization of labor or employment of proletarians on publicly owned land , in factories and workshops , with competition among the workers being abolished and with the factory owners , in so far as they still exist , being obliged to pay the same high wages as those paid by the state  . \
(  v  ) An equal obligation on all members of society to work until such time as private property has been completely abolished  .  Formation of industrial armies , especially for agriculture  . \
(  vi  ) Centralization of money and credit in the hands of the state through a national bank with state capital , and the suppression of all private banks and bankers  . \
(  vii  ) Increase in the number of national factories , workshops , railroads , ships ; bringing new lands into cultivation and improvement of land already under cultivation \'96 all in proportion to the growth of the capital and labor force at the disposal of the nation  . \
(  viii  ) Education of all children , from the moment they can leave their mother\'92s care , in national establishments at national cost  .  Education and production together  . \
(  ix  ) Construction , on public lands , of great palaces as communal dwellings for associated groups of citizens engaged in both industry and agriculture and combining in their way of life the advantages of urban and rural conditions while avoiding the one-sidedness and drawbacks of each  . \
(  x  ) Destruction of all unhealthy and jerry-built dwellings in urban districts  . \
(  xi  ) Equal inheritance rights for children born in and out of wedlock  . \
(  xii  ) Concentration of all means of transportation in the hands of the nation  . \
It is impossible , of course , to carry out all these measures at once  .  But one will always bring others in its wake  .  Once the first radical attack on private property has been launched , the proletariat will find itself forced to go ever further , to concentrate increasingly in the hands of the state all capital , all agriculture , all transport , all trade  .  All the foregoing measures are directed to this end ; and they will become practicable and feasible , capable of producing their centralizing effects to precisely the degree that the proletariat , through its labor , multiplies the country\'92s productive forces  . \
Finally , when all capital , all production , all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation , private property will disappear of its own accord , money will become superfluous , and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain  . \
\
\
\'97 19 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 Will it be possible for this revolution to take place in one country alone  ?\
No  .  By creating the world market , big industry has already brought all the peoples of the Earth , and especially the civilized peoples , into such close relation with one another that none is independent of what happens to the others  . \
Further , it has co-ordinated the social development of the civilized countries to such an extent that , in all of them , bourgeoisie and proletariat have become the decisive classes , and the struggle between them the great struggle of the day  .  It follows that the communist revolution will not merely be a national phenomenon but must take place simultaneously in all civilized countries \'96 that is to say , at least in England , America , France , and Germany  . \
It will develop in each of these countries more or less rapidly , according as one country or the other has a more developed industry , greater wealth , a more significant mass of productive forces  .  Hence , it will go slowest and will meet most obstacles in Germany , most rapidly and with the fewest difficulties in England  .  It will have a powerful impact on the other countries of the world , and will radically alter the course of development which they have followed up to now , while greatly stepping up its pace  . \
It is a universal revolution and will , accordingly , have a universal range  . \
\
\
\'97 20 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What will be the consequences of the\u8232 ultimate disappearance of private property  ?\
Society will take all forces of production and means of commerce , as well as the exchange and distribution of products , out of the hands of private capitalists and will manage them in accordance with a plan based on the availability of resources and the needs of the whole society  .  In this way , most important of all , the evil consequences which are now associated with the conduct of big industry will be abolished  . \
There will be no more crises ; the expanded production , which for the present order of society is overproduction and hence a prevailing cause of misery , will then be insufficient and in need of being expanded much further  .  Instead of generating misery , overproduction will reach beyond the elementary requirements of society to assure the satisfaction of the needs of all ; it will create new needs and , at the same time , the means of satisfying them  .  It will become the condition of , and the stimulus to , new progress , which will no longer throw the whole social order into confusion , as progress has always done in the past  .  Big industry , freed from the pressure of private property , will undergo such an expansion that what we now see will seem as petty in comparison as manufacture seems when put beside the big industry of our own day  .  This development of industry will make available to society a sufficient mass of products to satisfy the needs of everyone  . \
The same will be true of agriculture , which also suffers from the pressure of private property and is held back by the division of privately owned land into small parcels  .  Here , existing improvements and scientific procedures will be put into practice , with a resulting leap forward which will assure to society all the products it needs  . \
In this way , such an abundance of goods will be able to satisfy the needs of all its members  . \
The division of society into different , mutually hostile classes will then become unnecessary  .  Indeed , it will be not only unnecessary but intolerable in the new social order  .  The existence of classes originated in the division of labor , and the division of labor , as it has been known up to the present , will completely disappear  .  For mechanical and chemical processes are not enough to bring industrial and agricultural production up to the level we have described ; the capacities of the men who make use of these processes must undergo a corresponding development  . \
Just as the peasants and manufacturing workers of the last century changed their whole way of life and became quite different people when they were drawn into big industry , in the same way , communal control over production by society as a whole , and the resulting new development , will both require an entirely different kind of human material  . \
People will no longer be , as they are today , subordinated to a single branch of production , bound to it , exploited by it ; they will no longer develop\'a0one\'a0of their faculties at the expense of all others ; they will no longer know only\'a0one\'a0branch , or one branch of a single branch , of production as a whole  .  Even industry as it is today is finding such people less and less useful  . \
Industry controlled by society as a whole , and operated according to a plan , presupposes well-rounded human beings , their faculties developed in balanced fashion , able to see the system of production in its entirety  . \
The form of the division of labor which makes one a peasant , another a cobbler , a third a factory worker , a fourth a stock-market operator , has already been undermined by machinery and will completely disappear  .  Education will enable young people quickly to familiarize themselves with the whole system of production and to pass from one branch of production to another in response to the needs of society or their own inclinations  .  It will , therefore , free them from the one-sided character which the present-day division of labor impresses upon every individual  .  Communist society will , in this way , make it possible for its members to put their comprehensively developed faculties to full use  .  But , when this happens , classes will necessarily disappear  .  It follows that society organized on a communist basis is incompatible with the existence of classes on the one hand , and that the very building of such a society provides the means of abolishing class differences on the other  . \
A corollary of this is that the difference between city and country is destined to disappear  .  The management of agriculture and industry by the same people rather than by two different classes of people is , if only for purely material reasons , a necessary condition of communist association  .  The dispersal of the agricultural population on the land , alongside the crowding of the industrial population into the great cities , is a condition which corresponds to an undeveloped state of both agriculture and industry and can already be felt as an obstacle to further development  . \
The general co-operation of all members of society for the purpose of planned exploitation of the forces of production , the expansion of production to the point where it will satisfy the needs of all , the abolition of a situation in which the needs of some are satisfied at the expense of the needs of others , the complete liquidation of classes and their conflicts , the rounded development of the capacities of all members of society through the elimination of the present division of labor , through industrial education , through engaging in varying activities , through the participation by all in the enjoyments produced by all , through the combination of city and country \'96 these are the main consequences of the abolition of private property  . \
\
\
\'97 21 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What will be the influence of communist society on the family  ?\
It will transform the relations between the sexes into a purely private matter which concerns only the persons involved and into which society has no occasion to intervene  .  It can do this since it does away with private property and educates children on a communal basis , and in this way removes the two bases of traditional marriage \'96 the dependence rooted in private property , of the women on the man , and of the children on the parents  . \
And here is the answer to the outcry of the highly moral philistines against the \'93community of women\'94  .  Community of women is a condition which belongs entirely to bourgeois society and which today finds its complete expression in prostitution  .  But prostitution is based on private property and falls with it  .  Thus , communist society , instead of introducing community of women , in fact abolishes it  . \
\
\
\'97 22 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What will be the attitude of communism to existing nationalities  ?\
The nationalities of the peoples associating themselves in accordance with the principle of community will be compelled to mingle with each other as a result of this association and thereby to dissolve themselves , just as the various estate and class distinctions must disappear through the abolition of their basis , private property  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm#nd"}}{\fldrslt  [ 3 ]}}\
\
\
\'97 23 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What will be its attitude to existing religions  ?\
All religions so far have been the expression of historical stages of development of individual peoples or groups of peoples  .  But communism is the stage of historical development which makes all existing religions superfluous and brings about their disappearance{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm#ne"}}{\fldrslt  [ 4 ]}}\
\
\
\'97 24 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 How do communists differ from socialists  ?\
The so-called socialists are divided into three categories  . \
\
 [  Reactionary Socialists  :  ]\
The first category consists of adherents of a feudal and patriarchal society which has already been destroyed , and is still daily being destroyed , by big industry and world trade and their creation , bourgeois society  .  This category concludes , from the evils of existing society , that feudal and patriarchal society must be restored because it was free of such evils  .  In one way or another , all their proposals are directed to this end  . \
This category of reactionary socialists , for all their seeming partisanship and their scalding tears for the misery of the proletariat , is nevertheless energetically opposed by the communists for the following reasons  :\
(  i  ) It strives for something which is entirely impossible  . \
(  ii  ) It seeks to establish the rule of the aristocracy , the guildmasters , the small producers , and their retinue of absolute or feudal monarchs , officials , soldiers , and priests \'96 a society which was , to be sure , free of the evils of present-day society but which brought it at least as many evils without even offering to the oppressed workers the prospect of liberation through a communist revolution  . \
(  iii  ) As soon as the proletariat becomes revolutionary and communist , these reactionary socialists show their true colors by immediately making common cause with the bourgeoisie against the proletarians  . \
\
 [  Bourgeois Socialists  :  ]\
The second category consists of adherents of present-day society who have been frightened for its future by the evils to which it necessarily gives rise  .  What they want , therefore , is to maintain this society while getting rid of the evils which are an inherent part of it  . \
To this end , some propose mere welfare measures \'96 while others come forward with grandiose systems of reform which , under the pretense of re-organizing society , are in fact intended to preserve the foundations , and hence the life , of existing society  . \
Communists must unremittingly struggle against these bourgeois socialists because they work for the enemies of communists and protect the society which communists aim to overthrow  . \
\
 [  Democratic Socialists  :  ]\
Finally , the third category consists of democratic socialists who favor some of the same measures the communists advocate , as described in Question 18 , not as part of the transition to communism , however , but as measures which they believe will be sufficient to abolish the misery and evils of present-day society  . \
These democratic socialists are either proletarians who are not yet sufficiently clear about the conditions of the liberation of their class , or they are representatives of the petty bourgeoisie , a class which , prior to the achievement of democracy and the socialist measures to which it gives rise , has many interests in common with the proletariat  . \
It follows that , in moments of action , the communists will have to come to an understanding with these democratic socialists , and in general to follow as far as possible a common policy with them \'96 provided that these socialists do not enter into the service of the ruling bourgeoisie and attack the communists  . \
It is clear that this form of co-operation in action does not exclude the discussion of differences  . \
\
\
\'97 25 \'97\'a0\uc0\u8232 What is the attitude of the communists to the\u8232 other political parties of our time  ?\
This attitude is different in the different countries  . \
In England , France , and Belgium , where the bourgeoisie rules , the communists still have a common interest with the various democratic parties , an interest which is all the greater the more closely the socialistic measures they champion approach the aims of the communists \'96 that is , the more clearly and definitely they represent the interests of the proletariat and the more they depend on the proletariat for support  .  In England , for example , the working-class\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm#nf"}}{\fldrslt Chartists}}\'a0are infinitely closer to the communists than the democratic petty bourgeoisie or the so-called Radicals  . \
In America , where a democratic constitution has already been established , the communists must make the common cause with the party which will turn this constitution against the bourgeoisie and use it in the interests of the proletariat \'96 that is , with the agrarian\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm#6"}}{\fldrslt National Reformers}}  . \
In Switzerland , the Radicals , though a very mixed party , are the only group with which the communists can co-operate , and , among these Radicals , the Vaudois and Genevese are the most advanced  . \
In Germany , finally , the decisive struggle now on the order of the day is that between the bourgeoisie and the absolute monarchy  .  Since the communists cannot enter upon the decisive struggle between themselves and the bourgeoisie until the bourgeoisie is in power , it follows that it is in the interest of the communists to help the bourgeoisie to power as soon as possible in order the sooner to be able to overthrow it  .  Against the governments , therefore , the communists must continually support the radical liberal party , taking care to avoid the self-deceptions of the bourgeoisie and not fall for the enticing promises of benefits which a victory for the bourgeoisie would allegedly bring to the proletariat  .  The sole advantages which the proletariat would derive from a bourgeois victory would consist\
(  i  ) in various concessions which would facilitate the unification of the proletariat into a closely knit , battle-worthy , and organized class ; and\
(  ii  ) in the certainly that , on the very day the absolute monarchies fall , the struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat will start  .  From that day on , the policy of the communists will be the same as it now is in the countries where the bourgeoisie is already in power  . \
A spectre is haunting Europe \'97 the spectre of communism  .  All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre  : Pope and Tsar , Metternich and Guizot , French Radicals and German police-spies  . \
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power  ? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism , against the more advanced opposition parties , as well as against its reactionary adversaries  ?\
Two things result from this fact  :\
I  .  Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power  . \
II  .  It is high time that Communists should openly , in the face of the whole world , publish their views , their aims , their tendencies , and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself  . \
To this end , Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto , to be published in the English , French , German , Italian , Flemish and Danish\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/xlang/marx.htm"}}{\fldrslt languages}}  . \

Freeman and slave , patrician and plebeian , lord and serf , guild-master{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a3"}}{\fldrslt (  3  )}}\'a0and journeyman , in a word , oppressor and oppressed , stood in constant opposition to one another , carried on an uninterrupted , now hidden , now open fight , a fight that each time ended , either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes  . \
In the earlier epochs of history , we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders , a manifold gradation of social rank  .  In ancient Rome we have patricians , knights , plebeians , slaves ; in the Middle Ages , feudal lords , vassals , guild-masters , journeymen , apprentices , serfs ; in almost all of these classes , again , subordinate gradations  . \
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms  .  It has but established new classes , new conditions of oppression , new forms of struggle in place of the old ones  . \
Our epoch , the epoch of the bourgeoisie , possesses , however , this distinct feature  : it has simplified class antagonisms  .  Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps , into two great classes directly facing each other \'97 Bourgeoisie and Proletariat  . \
From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns  .  From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed  . \
The discovery of America , the rounding of the Cape , opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie  .  The East-Indian and Chinese markets , the colonisation of America , trade with the colonies , the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally , gave to commerce , to navigation , to industry , an impulse never before known , and thereby , to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society , a rapid development  . \
The feudal system of industry , in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds , now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets  .  The manufacturing system took its place  .  The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class ; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop  . \
Meantime the markets kept ever growing , the demand ever rising  .  Even manufacturer no longer sufficed  .  Thereupon , steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production  .  The place of manufacture was taken by the giant , Modern Industry ; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires , the leaders of the whole industrial armies , the modern bourgeois  . \
Modern industry has established the world market , for which the discovery of America paved the way  .  This market has given an immense development to commerce , to navigation , to communication by land  .  This development has , in its turn , reacted on the extension of industry ; and in proportion as industry , commerce , navigation , railways extended , in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed , increased its capital , and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages  . \
We see , therefore , how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development , of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange  . \
Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class  .  An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility , an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a4"}}{\fldrslt (  4  )}}  : here independent urban republic (  as in Italy and Germany  ) ; there taxable \'93third estate\'94 of the monarchy (  as in France  ) ; afterwards , in the period of manufacturing proper , serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility , and , in fact , cornerstone of the great monarchies in general , the bourgeoisie has at last , since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market , conquered for itself , in the modern representative State , exclusive political sway  .  The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie  . \
The bourgeoisie , historically , has played a most revolutionary part  . \
The bourgeoisie , wherever it has got the upper hand , has put an end to all feudal , patriarchal , idyllic relations  .  It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \'93natural superiors\'94 , and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest , than callous \'93cash payment\'94  .  It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour , of chivalrous enthusiasm , of philistine sentimentalism , in the icy water of egotistical calculation  .  It has resolved personal worth into exchange value , and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms , has set up that single , unconscionable freedom \'97 Free Trade  .  In one word , for exploitation , veiled by religious and political illusions , it has substituted naked , shameless , direct , brutal exploitation  . \
The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe  .  It has converted the physician , the lawyer , the priest , the poet , the man of science , into its paid wage labourers  . \
The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil , and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation  . \
The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages , which reactionaries so much admire , found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence  .  It has been the first to show what man\'92s activity can bring about  .  It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids , Roman aqueducts , and Gothic cathedrals ; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades  . \
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production , and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society  .  Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form , was , on the contrary , the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes  .  Constant revolutionising of production , uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions , everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones  .  All fixed , fast-frozen relations , with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions , are swept away , all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify  .  All that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned , and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life , and his relations with his kind  . \
The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe  .  It must nestle everywhere , settle everywhere , establish connexions everywhere  . \
The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country  .  To the great chagrin of Reactionists , it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood  .  All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed  .  They are dislodged by new industries , whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations , by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material , but raw material drawn from the remotest zones ; industries whose products are consumed , not only at home , but in every quarter of the globe  .  In place of the old wants , satisfied by the production of the country , we find new wants , requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes  .  In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency , we have intercourse in every direction , universal inter-dependence of nations  .  And as in material , so also in intellectual production  .  The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property  .  National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible , and from the numerous national and local literatures , there arises a world literature  . \
The bourgeoisie , by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production , by the immensely facilitated means of communication , draws all , even the most barbarian , nations into civilisation  .  The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls , with which it forces the barbarians\'92 intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate  .  It compels all nations , on pain of extinction , to adopt the bourgeois mode of production ; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst , i  . e  .  , to become bourgeois themselves  .  In one word , it creates a world after its own image  . \
The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns  .  It has created enormous cities , has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural , and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life  .  Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns , so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones , nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois , the East on the West  . \
The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population , of the means of production , and of property  .  It has agglomerated population , centralised the means of production , and has concentrated property in a few hands  .  The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation  .  Independent , or but loosely connected provinces , with separate interests , laws , governments , and systems of taxation , became lumped together into one nation , with one government , one code of laws , one national class-interest , one frontier , and one customs-tariff  . \
The bourgeoisie , during its rule of scarce one hundred years , has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together  .  Subjection of Nature\'92s forces to man , machinery , application of chemistry to industry and agriculture , steam-navigation , railways , electric telegraphs , clearing of whole continents for cultivation , canalisation of rivers , whole populations conjured out of the ground \'97 what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour  ?\
We see then  : the means of production and of exchange , on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up , were generated in feudal society  .  At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange , the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged , the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry , in one word , the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces ; they became so many fetters  .  They had to be burst asunder ; they were burst asunder  . \
Into their place stepped free competition , accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it , and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class  . \
A similar movement is going on before our own eyes  .  Modern bourgeois society , with its relations of production , of exchange and of property , a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange , is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells  .  For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production , against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule  .  It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial , each time more threateningly  .  In these crises , a great part not only of the existing products , but also of the previously created productive forces , are periodically destroyed  .  In these crises , there breaks out an epidemic that , in all earlier epochs , would have seemed an absurdity \'97 the epidemic of over-production  .  Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism ; it appears as if a famine , a universal war of devastation , had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence ; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed ; and why  ? Because there is too much civilisation , too much means of subsistence , too much industry , too much commerce  .  The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property ; on the contrary , they have become too powerful for these conditions , by which they are fettered , and so soon as they overcome these fetters , they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society , endanger the existence of bourgeois property  .  The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them  .  And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises  ? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces ; on the other , by the conquest of new markets , and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones  .  That is to say , by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises , and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented  . \
The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself  . \
But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself ; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons \'97 the modern working class \'97 the proletarians  . \
In proportion as the bourgeoisie , i  . e  .  , capital , is developed , in the same proportion is the proletariat , the modern working class , developed \'97 a class of labourers , who live only so long as they find work , and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital  .  These labourers , who must sell themselves piecemeal , are a commodity , like every other article of commerce , and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition , to all the fluctuations of the market  . \
Owing to the extensive use of machinery , and to the division of labour , the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character , and , consequently , all charm for the workman  .  He becomes an appendage of the machine , and it is only the most simple , most monotonous , and most easily acquired knack , that is required of him  .  Hence , the cost of production of a workman is restricted , almost entirely , to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance , and for the propagation of his race  .  But the price of a commodity , and therefore also of labour , is equal to its cost of production  .  In proportion , therefore , as the repulsiveness of the work increases , the wage decreases  .  Nay more , in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases , in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases , whether by prolongation of the working hours , by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery , etc  . \
Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist  .  Masses of labourers , crowded into the factory , are organised like soldiers  .  As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants  .  Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class , and of the bourgeois State ; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine , by the overlooker , and , above all , by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself  .  The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim , the more petty , the more hateful and the more embittering it is  . \
The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour , in other words , the more modern industry becomes developed , the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women  .  Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class  .  All are instruments of labour , more or less expensive to use , according to their age and sex  . \
No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer , so far , at an end , that he receives his wages in cash , than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie , the landlord , the shopkeeper , the pawnbroker , etc  . \
The lower strata of the middle class \'97 the small tradespeople , shopkeepers , and retired tradesmen generally , the handicraftsmen and peasants \'97 all these sink gradually into the proletariat , partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on , and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists , partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production  .  Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population  . \
The proletariat goes through various stages of development  .  With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie  .  At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers , then by the workpeople of a factory , then by the operative of one trade , in one locality , against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them  .  They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production , but against the instruments of production themselves ; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour , they smash to pieces machinery , they set factories ablaze , they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages  . \
At this stage , the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country , and broken up by their mutual competition  .  If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies , this is not yet the consequence of their own active union , but of the union of the bourgeoisie , which class , in order to attain its own political ends , is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion , and is moreover yet , for a time , able to do so  .  At this stage , therefore , the proletarians do not fight their enemies , but the enemies of their enemies , the remnants of absolute monarchy , the landowners , the non-industrial bourgeois , the petty bourgeois  .  Thus , the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie ; every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie  . \
But with the development of industry , the proletariat not only increases in number ; it becomes concentrated in greater masses , its strength grows , and it feels that strength more  .  The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised , in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour , and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level  .  The growing competition among the bourgeois , and the resulting commercial crises , make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating  .  The increasing improvement of machinery , ever more rapidly developing , makes their livelihood more and more precarious ; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes  .  Thereupon , the workers begin to form combinations (  Trades\'92 Unions  ) against the bourgeois ; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages ; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts  .  Here and there , the contest breaks out into riots  . \
Now and then the workers are victorious , but only for a time  .  The real fruit of their battles lies , not in the immediate result , but in the ever expanding union of the workers  .  This union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry , and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another  .  It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles , all of the same character , into one national struggle between classes  .  But every class struggle is a political struggle  .  And that union , to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages , with their miserable highways , required centuries , the modern proletarian , thanks to railways , achieve in a few years  . \
This organisation of the proletarians into a class , and , consequently into a political party , is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves  .  But it ever rises up again , stronger , firmer , mightier  .  It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers , by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself  .  Thus , the ten-hours\'92 bill in England was carried  . \
Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further , in many ways , the course of development of the proletariat  .  The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle  .  At first with the aristocracy ; later on , with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself , whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry ; at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries  .  In all these battles , it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat , to ask for help , and thus , to drag it into the political arena  .  The bourgeoisie itself , therefore , supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education , in other words , it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie  . \
Further , as we have already seen , entire sections of the ruling class are , by the advance of industry , precipitated into the proletariat , or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence  .  These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress  . \
Finally , in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour , the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class , in fact within the whole range of old society , assumes such a violent , glaring character , that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift , and joins the revolutionary class , the class that holds the future in its hands  .  Just as , therefore , at an earlier period , a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie , so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat , and in particular , a portion of the bourgeois ideologists , who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole  . \
Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today , the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class  .  The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry ; the proletariat is its special and essential product  . \
The lower middle class , the small manufacturer , the shopkeeper , the artisan , the peasant , all these fight against the bourgeoisie , to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class  .  They are therefore not revolutionary , but conservative  .  Nay more , they are reactionary , for they try to roll back the wheel of history  .  If by chance , they are revolutionary , they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat ; they thus defend not their present , but their future interests , they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat  . \
The \'93dangerous class\'94 ,\'a0 [ lumpenproletariat ]\'a0the social scum , that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society , may , here and there , be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution ; its conditions of life , however , prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue  . \
In the condition of the proletariat , those of old society at large are already virtually swamped  .  The proletarian is without property ; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations ; modern industry labour , modern subjection to capital , the same in England as in France , in America as in Germany , has stripped him of every trace of national character  .  Law , morality , religion , are to him so many bourgeois prejudices , behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests  . \
All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation  .  The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society , except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation , and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation  .  They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify ; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for , and insurances of , individual property  . \
All previous historical movements were movements of minorities , or in the interest of minorities  .  The proletarian movement is the self-conscious , independent movement of the immense majority , in the interest of the immense majority  .  The proletariat , the lowest stratum of our present society , cannot stir , cannot raise itself up , without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air  . \
Though not in substance , yet in form , the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle  .  The proletariat of each country must , of course , first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie  . \
In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat , we traced the more or less veiled civil war , raging within existing society , up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution , and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat  . \
Hitherto , every form of society has been based , as we have already seen , on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes  .  But in order to oppress a class , certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can , at least , continue its slavish existence  .  The serf , in the period of serfdom , raised himself to membership in the commune , just as the petty bourgeois , under the yoke of the feudal absolutism , managed to develop into a bourgeois  .  The modern labourer , on the contrary , instead of rising with the process of industry , sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class  .  He becomes a pauper , and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth  .  And here it becomes evident , that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society , and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law  .  It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery , because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state , that it has to feed him , instead of being fed by him  .  Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie , in other words , its existence is no longer compatible with society  . \
The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital ; the condition for capital is wage-labour  .  Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers  .  The advance of industry , whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie , replaces the isolation of the labourers , due to competition , by the revolutionary combination , due to association  .  The development of Modern Industry , therefore , cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products  .  What the bourgeoisie therefore produces , above all , are its own grave-diggers  .  Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable  . \
In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole  ?\
The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties  . \
They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole  . \
They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own , by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement  . \
The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only  :\'a01  .  In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries , they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat , independently of all nationality  . \'a02  .  In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through , they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole  . \
The Communists , therefore , are on the one hand , practically , the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country , that section which pushes forward all others ; on the other hand , theoretically , they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march , the conditions , and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement  . \
The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties  : formation of the proletariat into a class , overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy , conquest of political power by the proletariat  . \
The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented , or discovered , by this or that would-be universal reformer  . \
They merely express , in general terms , actual relations springing from an existing class struggle , from a historical movement going on under our very eyes  .  The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism  . \
All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions  . \
The French Revolution , for example , abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property  . \
The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally , but the abolition of bourgeois property  .  But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products , that is based on class antagonisms , on the exploitation of the many by the few  . \
In this sense , the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence  : Abolition of private property  . \
We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man\'92s own labour , which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom , activity and independence  . \
Hard-won , self-acquired , self-earned property  ! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant , a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form  ? There is no need to abolish that ; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it , and is still destroying it daily  . \
Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property  ?\
But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer  ? Not a bit  .  It creates capital ,\'a0i  . e  .  , that kind of property which exploits wage-labour , and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation  .  Property , in its present form , is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour  .  Let us examine both sides of this antagonism  . \
To be a capitalist , is to have not only a purely personal , but a social\'a0status\'a0in production  .  Capital is a collective product , and only by the united action of many members , nay , in the last resort , only by the united action of all members of society , can it be set in motion  . \
Capital is therefore not only personal ; it is a social power  . \
When , therefore , capital is converted into common property , into the property of all members of society , personal property is not thereby transformed into social property  .  It is only the social character of the property that is changed  .  It loses its class character  . \
Let us now take wage-labour  . \
The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage ,\'a0i  . e  .  , that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer  .  What , therefore , the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour , merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence  .  We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour , an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life , and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others  .  All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation , under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital , and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it  . \
In bourgeois society , living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour  .  In Communist society , accumulated labour is but a means to widen , to enrich , to promote the existence of the labourer  . \
In bourgeois society , therefore , the past dominates the present ; in Communist society , the present dominates the past  .  In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality , while the living person is dependent and has no individuality  . \
And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois , abolition of individuality and freedom  ! And rightly so  .  The abolition of bourgeois individuality , bourgeois independence , and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at  . \
By freedom is meant , under the present bourgeois conditions of production , free trade , free selling and buying  . \
But if selling and buying disappears , free selling and buying disappears also  .  This talk about free selling and buying , and all the other \'93brave words\'94 of our bourgeois about freedom in general , have a meaning , if any , only in contrast with restricted selling and buying , with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages , but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling , of the bourgeois conditions of production , and of the bourgeoisie itself  . \
You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property  .  But in your existing society , private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population ; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths  .  You reproach us , therefore , with intending to do away with a form of property , the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society  . \
In one word , you reproach us with intending to do away with your property  .  Precisely so ; that is just what we intend  . \
From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital , money , or rent , into a social power capable of being monopolised ,\'a0i  . e  .  , from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property , into capital , from that moment , you say , individuality vanishes  . \
You must , therefore , confess that by \'93individual\'94 you mean no other person than the bourgeois , than the middle-class owner of property  .  This person must , indeed , be swept out of the way , and made impossible  . \
Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society ; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations  . \
It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property , all work will cease , and universal laziness will overtake us  . \
According to this , bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness ; for those of its members who work , acquire nothing , and those who acquire anything do not work  .  The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology  : that there can no longer be any wage-labour when there is no longer any capital  . \
All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products , have , in the same way , been urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products  .  Just as , to the bourgeois , the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself , so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture  . \
That culture , the loss of which he laments , is , for the enormous majority , a mere training to act as a machine  . \
But don\'92t wrangle with us so long as you apply , to our intended abolition of bourgeois property , the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom , culture , law , &c  .  Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property , just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all , a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class  . \
The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason , the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property \'96 historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production \'96 this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you  .  What you see clearly in the case of ancient property , what you admit in the case of feudal property , you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property  . \
Abolition  [ Aufhebung ] of the family  ! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists  . \
On what foundation is the present family , the bourgeois family , based  ? On capital , on private gain  .  In its completely developed form , this family exists only among the bourgeoisie  .  But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians , and in public prostitution  . \
The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes , and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital  . \
Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents  ? To this crime we plead guilty  . \
But , you say , we destroy the most hallowed of relations , when we replace home education by social  . \
And your education  ! Is not that also social , and determined by the social conditions under which you educate , by the intervention direct or indirect , of society , by means of schools , &c  .   ? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education ; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention , and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class  . \
The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education , about the hallowed co-relation of parents and child , becomes all the more disgusting , the more , by the action of Modern Industry , all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder , and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour  . \
But you Communists would introduce community of women , screams the bourgeoisie in chorus  . \
The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production  .  He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common , and , naturally , can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women  . \
He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production  . \
For the rest , nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which , they pretend , is to be openly and officially established by the Communists  .  The Communists have no need to introduce community of women ; it has existed almost from time immemorial  . \
Our bourgeois , not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal , not to speak of common prostitutes , take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other\'92s wives  . \
Bourgeois marriage is , in reality , a system of wives in common and thus , at the most , what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce , in substitution for a hypocritically concealed , an openly legalised community of women  .  For the rest , it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system ,\'a0i  . e  .  , of prostitution both public and private  . \
The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality  . \
The working men have no country  .  We cannot take from them what they have not got  .  Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy , must rise to be the leading class of the nation , must constitute itself\'a0the\'a0nation , it is so far , itself national , though not in the bourgeois sense of the word  . \
National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing , owing to the development of the bourgeoisie , to freedom of commerce , to the world market , to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto  . \
The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster  .  United action , of the leading civilised countries at least , is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat  . \
In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to , the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to  .  In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes , the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end  . \
The charges against Communism made from a religious , a philosophical and , generally , from an ideological standpoint , are not deserving of serious examination  . \
Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man\'92s ideas , views , and conception , in one word , man\'92s consciousness , changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence , in his social relations and in his social life  ?\
What else does the history of ideas prove , than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed  ? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class  . \
When people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society , they do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created , and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence  . \
When the ancient world was in its last throes , the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity  .  When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas , feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie  .  The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge  . \
\'93Undoubtedly ,\'94 it will be said , \'93religious , moral , philosophical , and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development  .  But religion , morality , philosophy , political science , and law , constantly survived this change  . \'94\
\'93There are , besides , eternal truths , such as Freedom , Justice , etc  .  , that are common to all states of society  .  But Communism abolishes eternal truths , it abolishes all religion , and all morality , instead of constituting them on a new basis ; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience  . \'94\
What does this accusation reduce itself to  ? The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms , antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs  . \
But whatever form they may have taken , one fact is common to all past ages ,\'a0viz  .  , the exploitation of one part of society by the other  .  No wonder , then , that the social consciousness of past ages , despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays , moves within certain common forms , or general ideas , which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms  . \
The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations ; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas  . \
But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism  . \
We have seen above , that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy  . \
The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest , by degree , all capital from the bourgeoisie , to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State ,\'a0i  . e  .  , of the proletariat organised as the ruling class ; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible  . \
Of course , in the beginning , this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property , and on the conditions of bourgeois production ; by means of measures , therefore , which appear economically insufficient and untenable , but which , in the course of the movement , outstrip themselves , necessitate further inroads upon the old social order , and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production  . \
These measures will , of course , be different in different countries  . \
Nevertheless , in most advanced countries , the following will be pretty generally applicable  . \
1  .  Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes  . \'a0\uc0\u8232 2  .  A heavy progressive or graduated income tax  . \'a0\u8232 3  .  Abolition of all rights of inheritance  . \'a0\u8232 4  .  Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels  . \'a0\u8232 5  .  Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state , by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly  . \'a0\u8232 6  .  Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State  . \'a0\u8232 7  .  Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State ; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands , and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan  . \'a0\u8232 8  .  Equal liability of all to work  .  Establishment of industrial armies , especially for agriculture  . \'a0\u8232 9  .  Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries ; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country  . \'a0\u8232 10  .  Free education for all children in public schools  .  Abolition of children\'92s factory labour in its present form  .  Combination of education with industrial production , &c , &c  . \
When , in the course of development , class distinctions have disappeared , and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation , the public power will lose its political character  .  Political power , properly so called , is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another  .  If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled , by the force of circumstances , to organise itself as a class , if , by means of a revolution , it makes itself the ruling class , and , as such , sweeps away by force the old conditions of production , then it will , along with these conditions , have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally , and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class  . \
In place of the old bourgeois society , with its classes and class antagonisms , we shall have an association , in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all  . \
1  .  Reactionary Socialism\
A  .  Feudal Socialism\
Owing to their historical position , it became the vocation of the aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society  .  In the French Revolution of July 1830 , and in the English reform agitation{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch03.htm#e1"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}} , these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart  .  Thenceforth , a serious political struggle was altogether out of the question  .  A literary battle alone remained possible  .  But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch03.htm#a1"}}{\fldrslt (  1  )}}\
In order to arouse sympathy , the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight , apparently , of its own interests , and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone  .  Thus , the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe  . \
In this way arose feudal Socialism  : half lamentation , half lampoon ; half an echo of the past , half menace of the future ; at times , by its bitter , witty and incisive criticism , striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart\'92s core ; but always ludicrous in its effect , through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history  . \
The aristocracy , in order to rally the people to them , waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner  .  But the people , so often as it joined them , saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms , and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter  . \
One section of the French\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#legitimists"}}{\fldrslt Legitimists}}\'a0and \'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/y/o.htm#young-england"}}{\fldrslt Young England}}\'94 exhibited this spectacle  . \
In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie , the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now antiquated  .  In showing that , under their rule , the modern proletariat never existed , they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society  . \
For the rest , so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeois amounts to this , that under the bourgeois\'a0r\'e9gime a class is being developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society  . \
What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it creates a\'a0revolutionary\'a0proletariat  . \
In political practice , therefore , they join in all coercive measures against the working class ; and in ordinary life , despite their high-falutin phrases , they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry , and to barter truth , love , and honour , for traffic in wool , beetroot-sugar , and potato spirits  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch03.htm#a2"}}{\fldrslt (  2  )}}\
As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord , so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism  . \
Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge  .  Has not Christianity declaimed against private property , against marriage , against the State  ? Has it not preached in the place of these , charity and poverty , celibacy and mortification of the flesh , monastic life and Mother Church  ? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat  . \
\
B  .  Petty-Bourgeois Socialism\
The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie , not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society  .  The medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie  .  In those countries which are but little developed , industrially and commercially , these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie  . \
In countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed , a new class of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/e.htm#petty-bourgeois"}}{\fldrslt petty bourgeois}}\'a0has been formed , fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie , and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society  .  The individual members of this class , however , are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition , and , as modern industry develops , they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society , to be replaced in manufactures , agriculture and commerce , by overlookers , bailiffs and shopmen  . \
In countries like France , where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population , it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use , in their criticism of the bourgeois\'a0r\'e9gime , the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois , and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes , should take up the cudgels for the working class  .  Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism  .  Sismondi was the head of this school , not only in France but also in England  . \
This school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production  .  It laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists  .  It proved , incontrovertibly , the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour ; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands ; overproduction and crises ; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant , the misery of the proletariat , the anarchy in production , the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth , the industrial war of extermination between nations , the dissolution of old moral bonds , of the old family relations , of the old nationalities  . \
In its positive aims , however , this form of Socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange , and with them the old property relations , and the old society , or to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange within the framework of the old property relations that have been , and were bound to be , exploded by those means  .  In either case , it is both reactionary and Utopian  . \
Its last words are  : corporate guilds for manufacture ; patriarchal relations in agriculture  . \
Ultimately , when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception , this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues  . \
\
C  .  German or \'93True\'94 Socialism\
The Socialist and Communist literature of France , a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power , and that was the expressions of the struggle against this power , was introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie , in that country , had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism  . \
German philosophers , would-be philosophers , and\'a0beaux esprits\'a0(  men of letters  ) , eagerly seized on this literature , only forgetting , that when these writings immigrated from France into Germany , French social conditions had not immigrated along with them  .  In contact with German social conditions , this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance and assumed a purely literary aspect  .  Thus , to the German philosophers of the Eighteenth Century , the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing more than the demands of \'93Practical Reason\'94 in general , and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified , in their eyes , the laws of pure Will , of Will as it was bound to be , of true human Will generally  . \
The work of the German\'a0literati\'a0consisted solely in bringing the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience , or rather , in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view  . \
This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated , namely , by translation  . \
It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints\'a0over\'a0the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written  .  The German\'a0literati\'a0reversed this process with the profane French literature  .  They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original  .  For instance , beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money , they wrote \'93Alienation of Humanity\'94 , and beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote \'93Dethronement of the Category of the General\'94 , and so forth  . \
The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the French historical criticisms , they dubbed \'93Philosophy of Action\'94 , \'93True Socialism\'94 , \'93German Science of Socialism\'94 , \'93Philosophical Foundation of Socialism\'94 , and so on  . \
The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated  .  And , since it ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other , he felt conscious of having overcome \'93French one-sidedness\'94 and of representing , not true requirements , but the requirements of Truth ; not the interests of the proletariat , but the interests of Human Nature , of Man in general , who belongs to no class , has no reality , who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy  . \
This German socialism , which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly , and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such a mountebank fashion , meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence  . \
The fight of the Germans , and especially of the Prussian bourgeoisie , against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy , in other words , the liberal movement , became more earnest  . \
By this , the long-wished for opportunity was offered to \'93True\'94 Socialism of confronting the political movement with the Socialist demands , of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism , against representative government , against bourgeois competition , bourgeois freedom of the press , bourgeois legislation , bourgeois liberty and equality , and of preaching to the masses that they had nothing to gain , and everything to lose , by this bourgeois movement  .  German Socialism forgot , in the nick of time , that the French criticism , whose silly echo it was , presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society , with its corresponding economic conditions of existence , and the political constitution adapted thereto , the very things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany  . \
To the absolute governments , with their following of parsons , professors , country squires , and officials , it served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie  . \
It was a sweet finish , after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets , with which these same governments , just at that time , dosed the German working-class risings  . \
While this \'93True\'94 Socialism thus served the government as a weapon for fighting the German bourgeoisie , it , at the same time , directly represented a reactionary interest , the interest of German Philistines  .  In Germany , the\'a0petty-bourgeois\'a0class , a relic of the sixteenth century , and since then constantly cropping up again under the various forms , is the real social basis of the existing state of things  . \
To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany  .  The industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction \'97 on the one hand , from the concentration of capital ; on the other , from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat  .  \'93True\'94 Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone  .  It spread like an epidemic  . \
The robe of speculative cobwebs , embroidered with flowers of rhetoric , steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment , this transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry \'93eternal truths\'94 , all skin and bone , served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public  . \
And on its part German Socialism recognised , more and more , its own calling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois Philistine  . \
It proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation , and the German petty Philistine to be the typical man  .  To every villainous meanness of this model man , it gave a hidden , higher , Socialistic interpretation , the exact contrary of its real character  .  It went to the extreme length of directly opposing the \'93brutally destructive\'94 tendency of Communism , and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles  .  With very few exceptions , all the so-called Socialist and Communist publications that now (  1847  ) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch03.htm#a3"}}{\fldrslt (  3  )}}\

\
2  .  Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism\
A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society  . \
To this section belong economists , philanthropists , humanitarians , improvers of the condition of the working class , organisers of charity , members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals , temperance fanatics , hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind  .  This form of socialism has , moreover , been worked out into complete systems  . \
We may cite Proudhon\'92s\'a0Philosophie de la Mis\'e8re\'a0as an example of this form  . \
The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom  .  They desire the existing state of society , minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements  .  They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat  .  The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best ; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems  .  In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system , and thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem , it but requires in reality , that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society , but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie  . \
A second , and more practical , but less systematic , form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform , but only a change in the material conditions of existence , in economical relations , could be of any advantage to them  .  By changes in the material conditions of existence , this form of Socialism , however , by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production , an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution , but administrative reforms , based on the continued existence of these relations ; reforms , therefore , that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour , but , at the best , lessen the cost , and simplify the administrative work , of bourgeois government  . \
Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when , and only when , it becomes a mere figure of speech  . \
Free trade  : for the benefit of the working class  .  Protective duties  : for the benefit of the working class  .  Prison Reform  : for the benefit of the working class  .  This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism  . \
It is summed up in the phrase  : the bourgeois is a bourgeois \'97 for the benefit of the working class  . \

\
3  .  Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism\
We do not here refer to that literature which , in every great modern revolution , has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat , such as the writings of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/b/a.htm#francois-babeuf"}}{\fldrslt Babeuf}}\'a0and others  . \
The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends , made in times of universal excitement , when feudal society was being overthrown , necessarily failed , owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat , as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation , conditions that had yet to be produced , and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone  .  The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character  .  It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form  . \
The Socialist and Communist systems , properly so called , those of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/s/a.htm#st-simon"}}{\fldrslt Saint-Simon}} ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/f/o.htm#fourier"}}{\fldrslt Fourier}} ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/o/w.htm#owen"}}{\fldrslt Owen}} , and others , spring into existence in the early undeveloped period , described above , of the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie (  see\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm"}}{\fldrslt Section 1  .  Bourgeois and Proletarians}}  )  . \
The founders of these systems see , indeed , the class antagonisms , as well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society  .  But the proletariat , as yet in its infancy , offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement  . \
Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry , the economic situation , as they find it , does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat  .  They therefore search after a new social science , after new social laws , that are to create these conditions  . \
Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action ; historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones ; and the gradual , spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat to an organisation of society especially contrived by these inventors  .  Future history resolves itself , in their eyes , into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans  . \
In the formation of their plans , they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the working class , as being the most suffering class  .  Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them  . \
The undeveloped state of the class struggle , as well as their own surroundings , causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms  .  They want to improve the condition of every member of society , even that of the most favoured  .  Hence , they habitually appeal to society at large , without the distinction of class ; nay , by preference , to the ruling class  .  For how can people , when once they understand their system , fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society  ?\
Hence , they reject all political , and especially all revolutionary action ; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means , necessarily doomed to failure , and by the force of example , to pave the way for the new social Gospel  . \
Such fantastic pictures of future society , painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position , correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society  . \
But these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical element  .  They attack every principle of existing society  .  Hence , they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class  .  The practical measures proposed in them \'97 such as the abolition of the distinction between town and country , of the family , of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals , and of the wage system , the proclamation of social harmony , the conversion of the function of the state into a more superintendence of production \'97 all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were , at that time , only just cropping up , and which , in these publications , are recognised in their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only  .  These proposals , therefore , are of a purely Utopian character  . \
The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an inverse relation to historical development  .  In proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape , this fantastic standing apart from the contest , these fantastic attacks on it , lose all practical value and all theoretical justification  .  Therefore , although the originators of these systems were , in many respects , revolutionary , their disciples have , in every case , formed mere reactionary sects  .  They hold fast by the original views of their masters , in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat  .  They , therefore , endeavour , and that consistently , to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms  .  They still dream of experimental realisation of their social Utopias , of founding isolated \'93phalansteres\'94 , of establishing \'93Home Colonies\'94 , or setting up a \'93Little Icaria\'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch03.htm#a4"}}{\fldrslt (  4  )}}\'a0\'97 duodecimo editions of the New Jerusalem \'97 and to realise all these castles in the air , they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois  .  By degrees , they sink into the category of the reactionary  [ or ] conservative Socialists depicted above , differing from these only by more systematic pedantry , and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science  . \
They , therefore , violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class ; such action , according to them , can only result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel  . \
The Owenites in England , and the Fourierists in France , respectively , oppose the Chartists and the\'a0R\'e9formistes  . \
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm"}}{\fldrslt Section II}}\'a0has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working-class parties , such as the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/c/h.htm#chartists"}}{\fldrslt Chartists}}\'a0in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America  . \
The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims , for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class ; but in the movement of the present , they also represent and take care of the future of that movement  .  In France , the Communists ally with the Social-Democrats{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch04.htm#a1"}}{\fldrslt (  1  )}}\'a0against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie , reserving , however , the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution  . \
In Switzerland , they support the Radicals , without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements , partly of Democratic Socialists , in the French sense , partly of radical bourgeois  . \
In Poland , they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation , that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846  . \
In Germany , they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way , against the absolute monarchy , the feudal squirearchy , and the petty bourgeoisie  . \
But they never cease , for a single instant , to instill into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat , in order that the German workers may straightway use , as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie , the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy , and in order that , after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany , the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin  . \
The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany , because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth , and France in the eighteenth century , and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution  . \
In short , the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things  . \
In all these movements , they bring to the front , as the leading question in each , the property question , no matter what its degree of development at the time  . \
Finally , they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries  . \
The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims  .  They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions  .  Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution  .  The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains  .  They have a world to win  . \
Working Men of All Countries , Unite  !\
This pamphlet first appeared in the form of a series of leading articles in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/newspapers/neue-rheinische-zeitung.htm"}}{\fldrslt Neue Rheinische Zeitung}} , beginning on April 4th , 1849  .  The text is made up of from lectures delivered by Marx before the German Workingmen\'92s Club of Brussels in 1847  .  The series was never completed  .  The promise \'93to be continued ,\'94 at the end of the editorial in Number 269 of the newspaper , remained unfulfilled in consequence of the precipitous events of that time  : the invasion of Hungary by the Russians\'a0 [ Tsarist troops invaded Hungary in 1849 to keep the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty in power ] , and the uprisings in Dresden , Iserlohn , Elberfeld , the Palatinate , and in Baden\'a0 [ Spontaneous uprisings in Germany in May-July 1849 , supporting the Imperial Constitution which were crushed in mid-July ] , which led to the suppression of the paper on May 19th , 1849  .  And among the papers left by Marx no manuscript of any continuation of these articles has been found  . \
\'93Wage-labour and Capital\'94 has appeared as an independent publication in several editions , the last of which was issued by the Swiss Co-operative Printing Association , in Hottingen-Zurich , in 1884  .  Hitherto , the several editions have contained the exact wording of the original articles  .  But since at least 10 ,000 copies of the present edition are to be circulated as a propaganda tract , the question necessarily forced itself upon me , would Marx himself , under these circumstance , have approved of an unaltered literal reproduction of the original  ?\
Marx , in the \'9240s , had not yet completed his criticism of political economy  .  This was not done until toward the end of the fifties  .  Consequently , such of his writings as were published before the first installment of his\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm"}}{\fldrslt Critique of Political Economy}}\'a0was finished , deviate in some points from those written after 1859 , and contain expressions and whole sentences which , viewed from the standpoint of his later writings , appear inexact , and even incorrect  .  Now , it goes without saying that in ordinary editions , intended for the public in general , this earlier standpoint , as a part of the intellectual development of the author , has its place ; that the author as well as the public , has an indisputable right to an unaltered reprint of these older writings  .  In such a case , I would not have dreamed of changing a single word in it  .  But it is otherwise when the edition is destined almost exclusively for the purpose of propaganda  .  In such a case , Marx himself would unquestionably have brought the old work , dating from 1849 , into harmony with his new point of view , and I feel sure that I am acting in his spirit when I insert in this edition the few changes and additions which are necessary in order to attain this object in all essential point  . \
Therefore , I say to the reader at once  : this pamphlet is not as Marx wrote it in 1849 , but approximately as Marx would have written it in 1891  .  Moreover , so many copies of the original text are in circulation , that these will suffice until I can publish it again unaltered in a complete edition of Marx\'92s works , to appear at some future time  . \
My alterations centre about one point  .  According to the original reading , the worker sells his\'a0labour\'a0for wages , which he receives from the capitalist ; according to the present text , he sells his\'a0labour-power  .  And for this change , I must render an explanation  : to the workers , in order that they may understand that we are not quibbling or word-juggling , but are dealing here with one of the most important points in the whole range of political economy ; to the bourgeois , in order that they may convince themselves how greatly the uneducated workers , who can be easily made to grasp the most difficult economic analyses , excel our supercilious \'93cultured  "   folk , for whom such ticklish problems remain insoluble their whole life long  . \
Classical political economy{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/intro.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\'a0borrowed from the industrial practice the current notion of the manufacturer , that he buys and pays for the labour of his employees  .  This conception had been quite serviceable for the business purposes of the manufacturer , his bookkeeping and price calculation  .  But naively carried over into political economy , it there produced truly wonderful errors and confusions  . \
Political economy finds it an established fact that the prices of all commodities , among them the price of the commodity which it calls \'93labour ,\'94 continually change ; that they rise and fall in consequence of the most diverse circumstances , which often have no connection whatsoever with the production of the commodities themselves , so that prices appear to be determined , as a rule , by pure chance  .  As soon , therefore , as political economy stepped forth as a science , it was one of its first tasks to search for the law that hid itself behind this chance , which apparently determined the prices of commodities , and which in reality controlled this very chance  .  Among the prices of commodities , fluctuating and oscillating , now upward , now downward , the fixed central point was searched for around which these fluctuations and oscillations were taking place  .  In short , starting from the price of commodities , political economy sought for the value of commodities as the regulating law , by means of which all price fluctuations could be explained , and to which they could all be reduced in the last resort  . \
And so , classical political economy found that the value of a commodity was determined by the labour incorporated in it and requisite to its production  .  With this explanation , it was satisfied  .  And we , too , may , for the present , stop at this point  .  But , to avoid misconceptions , I will remind the reader that today this explanation has become wholly inadequate  .  Marx was the first to investigate thoroughly into the value-forming quality of labour and to discover that not all labour which is apparently , or even really , necessary to the production of a commodity , imparts under all circumstances to this commodity a magnitude of value corresponding to the quantity of labour used up  .  If , therefore , we say today in short , with economists like Ricardo , that the value of a commodity is determined by the labour necessary to its production , we always imply the reservations and restrictions made by Marx  .  Thus much for our present purpose ; further information can be found in Marx\'92s\'a0Critique of Political Economy , which appeared in 1859 , and in the first volume of\'a0Capital  . \
But , as soon as the economists applied this determination of value by labour to the commodity \'93labour  "   , they fell from one contradiction into another  .  How is the value of \'93labour\'94 determined  ? By the necessary labour embodied in it  .  But how much labour is embodied in the labour of a labourer of a day a week , a month , a year  .  If labour is the measure of all values , we can express the \'93value of labour\'94 only in labour  .  But we know absolutely nothing about the value of an hour\'92s labour , if all that we know about it is that it is equal to one hour\'92s labour  .  So , thereby , we have not advanced one hair\'92s breadth nearer our goal ; we are constantly turning about in a circle  . \
Classical economics , therefore , essayed another turn  .  It said  : the value of a commodity is equal to its cost of production  .  But , what is the cost of production of \'93labour  "    ? In order to answer this question , the economists are forced to strain logic just a little  .  Instead of investigating the cost of production of labour itself , which , unfortunately , cannot be ascertained , they now investigate the cost of production of\'a0the labourer  .  And this latter can be ascertained  .  It changes according to time and circumstances , but for a given condition of society , in a given locality , and in a given branch of production , it , too , is given , at least within quite narrow limits  .  We live today under the regime of capitalist production , under which a large and steadily growing class of the population can live only on the condition that it works for the owners of the means of production \'96 tools , machines , raw materials , and means of subsistence \'96 in return for wages  .  On the basis of this mode of production , the labourer\'92s cost of production consists of the sum of the means of subsistence (  or their price in money  ) which on the average are requisite to enable him to work , to maintain in him this capacity for work , and to replace him at his departure , by reason of age , sickness , or death , with another labourer \'96 that is to say , to propagate the working class in required numbers  . \
Let us assume that the money price of these means of subsistence averages 3 shillings a day  .  Our labourer gets , therefore , a daily wage of 3 shillings from his employer  .  For this , the capitalist lets him work , say , 12 hours a day  .  Our capitalist , moreover , calculates somewhat in the following fashion  : Let us assume that our labourer (  a machinist  ) has to make a part of a machine which he finishes in one day  .  The raw material (  iron and brass in the necessary prepared form  ) costs 20 shillings  .  The consumption of coal by the steam-engine , the wear-and-tear of this engine itself , of the turning-lathe , and of the other tools with which our labourer works , represent , for one day and one labourer , a value of 1 shilling  .  The wages for one day are , according to our assumption , 3 shillings  .  This makes a total of 24 shillings for our piece of a machine  . \
But , the capitalist calculates that , on an average , he will receive for it a price of 27 shillings from his customers , or 3 shillings over and above his outlay  . \
Whence do they 3 shillings pocketed by the capitalist come  ? According to the assertion of classical political economy , commodities are in the long run sold at their values , that is , they are sold at prices which correspond to the necessary quantities of labour contained in them  .  The average price of our part of a machine \'96 27 shillings \'96 would therefore equal its value , i  . e  .  , equal the amount of labour embodied in it  .  But , of these 27 shillings , 21 shillings were values were values already existing before the machinist began to work ; 20 shillings were contained in the raw material , 1 shilling in the fuel consumed during the work and in the machines and tools used in the process and reduced in their efficiency to the value of this amount  .  There remains 6 shillings , which have been added to the value of the raw material  .  But , according to the supposition of our economists , themselves , these 6 shillings can arise only from the labour added to the raw material by the labourer  .  His 12 hours\'92 labour has created , according to this , a new value of 6 shillings  .  Therefore , the value of his 12 hours\'92 labour would be equivalent to 6 shillings  .  So we have at last discovered what the \'93value of labour\'94 is  . \
\'93Hold on there  !\'94 cries our machinist  .  \'93Six shillings  ? But I have received only 3 shillings  ! My capitalist swears high and day that the value of my 12 hours\'92 labour is no more than 3 shillings , and if I were to demand 6 , he\'92d laugh at me  .  What kind of a story is that  ?  "  \
If before this we got with our value of labour into a vicious circle , we now surely have driven straight into an insoluble contradiction  .  We searched for the value of labour , and we found more than we can use  .  For the labourer , the value of the 12 hours\'92 labour is 3 shillings ; for the capitalist , it is 6 shillings , of which he pays the workingman 3 shillings as wages , and pockets the remaining 3 shilling himself  .  According to this , labour has not one but two values , and , moreover , two very different values  !\
As soon as we reduce the values , now expressed in money , to labour-time , the contradiction becomes even more absurd  .  By the 12 hours\'92 labour , a new value of 6 shillings is created  .  Therefore , in 6 hours , the new value created equals 3 shillings \'96 the amount which the labourer receives for 12 hours\'92 labour  .  For 12 hours\'92 labour , the workingman receives , as an equivalent , the product of 6 hours\'92 labour  .  We are , thus , forced to one of two conclusions  : either labour has two values , one of which is twice as large as the other , or 12 equals 6  ! In both cases , we get pure absurdities  .  Turn and twist as we may , we will not get out of this contradiction as long as we speak of the buying and selling of \'93labour\'94 and of the \'93value of labour  . \'94 And just so it happened to the political economists  .  The last offshoot of classical political economy \'96 the Ricardian school \'96 was largely wrecked on the insolubility of this contradiction  .  Classical political economy had run itself into a blind alley  .  The man who discovered the way out of this blind alley was Karl Marx  . \
What the economists had considered as the cost of production of \'93labour\'94 was really the cost of production , not of \'93labour ,\'94 but of the living labourer himself  .  And what this labourer sold to the capitalist was not his labour  . \
\'93So soon as his labour really begins ,\'94 says Marx , \'93it ceases to belong to him , and therefore can no longer be sold by him  . \'94\
At the most , he could sell his\'a0future\'a0labour \'96 i  . e  .  , assume the obligation of executing a certain piece of work in a certain time  .  But , in this way , he does not sell labour (  which would first have to be performed  ) , but not for a stipulated payment he places his labour-power at the disposal of the capitalist for a certain time (  in case of time-wages  ) , or for the performance of a certain task (  in case of piece-wages  )  .  He hires out or sells his\'a0labour-power  .  But this labour-power has grown up with his person and is inseparable from it  .  Its cost of production , therefore , coincides with his own cost of production ; what the economist called the cost of production of labour is really the cost of production of the labourer , and therewith of his labour-power  .  And , thus , we can also go back from the cost of production of labour-power to the value of labour-power , and determine the quantity of social labour that is required for the production of a labour-power of a given quantity , as Marx has done in the chapter on \'93The Buying and Selling of labour Power  . \'94  [ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm"}}{\fldrslt Capital , Vol  . I}} ]\
Now what takes place after the worker has sold his labour-power , i  . e  .  , after he has placed his labour-power at the disposal of the capitalist for stipulated-wages \'96 whether time-wages or piece-wages  ? The capitalist takes the labourer into his workshop or factory , where all the articles required for the work can be found \'96 raw materials , auxiliary materials (  coal , dyestuffs , etc  .   ) , tools , and machines  .  Here , the worker begins to work  .  His daily wages are , as above , 3 shillings , and it makes no difference whether he earns them as day-wages or piece-wages  .  We again assume that in 12 hours the worker adds by his labour a new value of 6 shillings to the value of the raw materials consumed , which new value the capitalist realizes by the sale of the finished piece of work  .  Out of this new value , he pays the worker his 3 shillings , and the remaining 3 shillings he keeps for himself  .  If , now , the labourer creates in 12 hours a value of 6 shillings , in 6 hours he creates a value of 3 shillings  .  Consequently , after working 6 hours for the capitalist , the labourer has returned to him the equivalent of the 3 shillings received as wages  .  After 6 hours\'92 work , both are quits , neither one owing a penny to the other  . \
\'93Hold on there  !\'94 now cries out the capitalist  .  \'93I have hired the labourer for a whole day , for 12 hours  .  But 6 hours are only half-a-day  .  So work along lively there until the other 6 hours are at an end \'96 only then will we be even  . \'94 And , in fact , the labourer has to submit to the conditions of the contract upon which he entered of \'93his own free will  "   , and according to which he bound himself to work 12 whole hours for a product of labour which cost only 6 hours\'92 labour  . \
Similarly with piece-wages  .  Let us suppose that in 12 hours our worker makes 12 commodities  .  Each of these costs a shilling in raw materials and wear-and-tear , and is sold for 2  . 5 shillings  .  On our former assumption , the capitalist gives the labourer   . 25 of a shilling for each piece , which makes a total of 3 shillings for 12 pieces  .  To earn this , the worker requires 12 hours  .  The capitalist receives 30 shillings for the 12 pieces ; deducting 24 shillings for raw materials and wear-and-tear , there remains 6 shillings , of which he pays 3 shillings in wages and pockets the remaining 3  .  Just as before  ! Here , also , the worker labours 6 hours for himself \'96 i  . e  .  , to replace his wages (  half-an-hour in each of the 12 hours  ) , and 6 hours for the capitalist  . \
The rock upon which the best economists were stranded , as long as they started out from the value of labour , vanishes as soon as we make our starting-point the value of\'a0labour-power  .  labour-power is , in our present-day capitalist society , a commodity like every other commodity , but yet a very peculiar commodity  .  It has , namely , the peculiarity of being a value-creating force , the source of value , and , moreover , when properly treated , the source of more value than it possesses itself  .  In the present state of production , human labour-power not only produces in a day a greater value than it itself possesses and costs ; but with each new scientific discovery , with each new technical invention , there also rises the surplus of its daily production over its daily cost , while as a consequence there diminishes that part of the working-day in which the labourer produces the equivalent of his day\'92s wages , and , on the other hand , lengthens that part of the working-day in which he must present labour gratis to the capitalist  . \
And this is the economic constitution of our entire modern society  : the working class alone produces all values  .  For value is only another expression for labour , that expression , namely , by which is designated , in our capitalist society of today , the amount of socially necessary labour embodied in a particular commodity  .  But , these values produced by the workers do not belong to the workers  .  They belong to the owners of the raw materials , machines , tools , and money , which enable them to buy the labour-power of the working class  .  Hence , the working class gets back only a part of the entire mass of products produced by it  .  And , as we have just seen , the other portion , which the capitalist class retains , and which it has to share , at most , only with the landlord class , is increasing with every new discovery and invention , while the share which falls to the working class (  per capita  ) rises but little and very slowly , or not at all , and under certain conditions it may even fall  . \
But , these discoveries and inventions which supplant one another with ever-increasing speed , this productiveness of human labour which increases from day to day to unheard-of proportions , at last gives rise to a conflict , in which present capitalistic economy must go to ruin  .  On the one hand , immeasurable wealth and a superfluidity of products with which the buyers cannot cope  .  On the other hand , the great mass of society proletarianized , transformed into wage-labourers , and thereby disabled from appropriating to themselves that superfluidity of products  .  The splitting up of society into a small class , immoderately rich , and a large class of wage-labourers devoid of all property , brings it about that this society smothers in its own superfluidity , while the great majority of its members are scarcely , or not at all , protected from extreme want  . \
This condition becomes every day more absurd and more unnecessary  .  It\'a0must\'a0be gotten rid of ; it can be gotten rid of  .  A new social order is possible , in which the class differences of today will have disappeared , and in which \'96 perhaps after a short transition period , which , though somewhat deficient in other respects , will in any case be very useful morally \'96 there will be the means of life , of the enjoyment of life , and of the development and activity of all bodily and mental faculties , through the systematic use and further development of the enormous productive powers of society , which exists with us even now , with equal obligation upon all to work  .  And that the workers are growing ever more determined to achieve this new social order will be proven on both sides of the ocean on this dawning May Day , and on Sunday , May 3rd  . \'a0 [ Engels is referring to the May Day celebrations of 1891 ]\
FREDERICK ENGELS\'a0\uc0\u8232 London , April 30 , 1891  . \
From various quarters we have been reproached for neglecting to portray the economic conditions which form the material basis of the present struggles between classes and nations  .  With set purpose we have hitherto touched upon these conditions only when they forced themselves upon the surface of the political conflicts  . \
It was necessary , beyond everything else , to follow the development of the class struggle in the history of our own day , and to prove empirically , by the actual and daily newly created historical material , that with the subjugation of the working class , accomplished in the days of February and March , 1848 , the opponents of that class \'96 the bourgeois republicans in France , and the bourgeois and peasant classes who were fighting feudal absolutism throughout the whole continent of Europe \'96 were simultaneously conquered ; that the victory of the   "  moderate republic  "   in France sounded at the same time the fall of the nations which had responded to the February revolution with heroic wars of independence ; and finally that , by the victory over the revolutionary workingmen , Europe fell back into its old double slavery , into the English-Russian slavery  .  The June conflict in Paris , the fall of Vienna , the tragi-comedy in Berlin in November 1848 , the desperate efforts of Poland , Italy , and Hungary , the starvation of Ireland into submission \'96 these were the chief events in which the European class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class was summed up , and from which we proved that every revolutionary uprising , however remote from the class struggle its object might appear , must of necessity fail until the revolutionary working class shall have conquered ; \'96 that every social reform must remain a Utopia until the proletarian revolution and the feudalistic counter-revolution have been pitted against each other in a world-wide war  .  In our presentation , as in reality , Belgium and Switzerland were tragicomic caricaturish genre pictures in the great historic tableau ; the one the model State of the bourgeois monarchy , the other the model State of the bourgeois republic ; both of them , States that flatter themselves to be just as free from the class struggle as from the European revolution  . \
But now , after our readers have seen the class struggle of the year 1848 develop into colossal political proportions , it is time to examine more closely the economic conditions themselves upon which is founded the existence of the capitalist class and its class rule , as well as the slavery of the workers  . \
We shall present the subject in three great divisions  :\
The Relation of Wage-labour to Capital , the Slavery of the Worker , the Rule of the Capitalist  . \
The Inevitable Ruin of the Middle Classes  [ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/e.htm#petty-bourgeois"}}{\fldrslt petty-bourgeois}} ] and the so-called Commons  [ peasants ] under the present system  . \
The Commercial Subjugation and Exploitation of the Bourgeois classes of the various European nations by the Despot of the World Market \'96 England  . \
We shall seek to portray this as simply and popularly as possible , and shall not presuppose a knowledge of even the most elementary notions of political economy  .  We wish to be understood by the workers  .  And , moreover , there prevails in Germany the most remarkable ignorance and confusion of ideas in regard to the simplest economic relations , from the patented defenders of existing conditions , down to the socialist wonder-workers and the unrecognized political geniuses , in which divided Germany is even richer than in duodecimo princelings  .  We therefore proceed to the consideration of the first problem  . \
If several workmen were to be asked  :   "  How much wages do you get  ?  "   , one would reply ,   "  I get two shillings a day  "   , and so on  .  According to the different branches of industry in which they are employed , they would mention different sums of money that they receive from their respective employers for the completion of a certain task ; for example , for weaving a yard of linen , or for setting a page of type  .  Despite the variety of their statements , they would all agree upon one point  : that wages are the amount of money which the capitalist pays for a certain period of work or for a certain amount of work  . \
Consequently , it appears that the capitalist buys their labour with money , and that for money they sell him their labour  .  But this is merely an illusion  .  What they actually sell to the capitalist for money is their labour-power  .  This labour-power the capitalist buys for a day , a week , a month , etc  .  And after he has bought it , he uses it up by letting the worker labour during the stipulated time  .  With the same amount of money with which the capitalist has bought their labour-power (  for example , with two shillings  ) he could have bought a certain amount of sugar or of any other commodity  .  The two shillings with which he bought 20 pounds of sugar is the price of the 20 pounds of sugar  .  The two shillings with which he bought 12 hours' use of labour-power , is the price of 12 hours' labour  .  Labour-power , then , is a commodity , no more , no less so than is the sugar  .  The first is measured by the clock , the other by the scales  . \
Their commodity , labour-power , the workers exchange for the commodity of the capitalist , for money , and , moreover , this exchange takes place at a certain ratio  .  So much money for so long a use of labour-power  .  For 12 hours' weaving , two shillings  .  And these two shillings , do they not represent all the other commodities which I can buy for two shillings  ? Therefore , actually , the worker has exchanged his commodity , labour-power , for commodities of all kinds , and , moreover , at a certain ratio  .  By giving him two shillings , the capitalist has given him so much meat , so much clothing , so much wood , light , etc  .  , in exchange for his day's work  .  The two shillings therefore express the relation in which labour-power is exchanged for other commodities , the exchange-value of labour-power  . \
The exchange value of a commodity estimated in money is called its price  .  Wages therefore are only a special name for the price of labour-power , and are usually called the price of labour ; it is the special name for the price of this peculiar commodity , which has no other repository than human flesh and blood  . \
Let us take any worker ; for example , a weaver  .  The capitalist supplies him with the loom and yarn  .  The weaver applies himself to work , and the yarn is turned into cloth  .  The capitalist takes possession of the cloth and sells it for 20 shillings , for example  .  Now are the wages of the weaver a share of the cloth , of the 20 shillings , of the product of the work  ? By no means  .  Long before the cloth is sold , perhaps long before it is fully woven , the weaver has received his wages  .  The capitalist , then , does not pay his wages out of the money which he will obtain from the cloth , but out of money already on hand  .  Just as little as loom and yarn are the product of the weaver to whom they are supplied by the employer , just so little are the commodities which he receives in exchange for his commodity \'96 labour-power \'96 his product  .  It is possible that the employer found no purchasers at all for the cloth  .  It is possible that he did not get even the amount of the wages by its sale  .  It is possible that he sells it very profitably in proportion to the weaver's wages  .  But all that does not concern the weaver  .  With a part of his existing wealth , of his capital , the capitalist buys the labour-power of the weaver in exactly the same manner as , with another part of his wealth , he has bought the raw material \'96 the yarn \'96 and the instrument of labour \'96 the loom  .  After he has made these purchases , and among them belongs the labour-power necessary to the production of the cloth he produces only with raw materials and instruments of labour belonging to him  .  For our good weaver , too , is one of the instruments of labour , and being in this respect on a par with the loom , he has no more share in the product (  the cloth  ) , or in the price of the product , than the loom itself has  . \
Wages , therefore , are not a share of the worker in the commodities produced by himself  .  Wages are that part of already existing commodities with which the capitalist buys a certain amount of productive labour-power  . \
Consequently , labour-power is a commodity which its possessor , the wage-worker , sells to the capitalist  .  Why does he sell it  ? It is in order to live  . \
But the putting of labour-power into action \'96 i  . e  .  , the work \'96 is the active expression of the labourer's own life  .  And this life activity he sells to another person in order to secure the necessary means of life  .  His life-activity , therefore , is but a means of securing his own existence  .  He works that he may keep alive  .  He does not count the labour itself as a part of his life ; it is rather a sacrifice of his life  .  It is a commodity that he has auctioned off to another  .  The product of his activity , therefore , is not the aim of his activity  .  What he produces for himself is not the silk that he weaves , not the gold that he draws up the mining shaft , not the palace that he builds  .  What he produces for himself is wages ; and the silk , the gold , and the palace are resolved for him into a certain quantity of necessaries of life , perhaps into a cotton jacket , into copper coins , and into a basement dwelling  .  And the labourer who for 12 hours long , weaves , spins , bores , turns , builds , shovels , breaks stone , carries hods , and so on \'96 is this 12 hours' weaving , spinning , boring , turning , building , shovelling , stone-breaking , regarded by him as a manifestation of life , as life  ? Quite the contrary  .  Life for him begins where this activity ceases , at the table , at the tavern , in bed  .  The 12 hours' work , on the other hand , has no meaning for him as weaving , spinning , boring , and so on , but only as earnings , which enable him to sit down at a table , to take his seat in the tavern , and to lie down in a bed  .  If the silk-worm's object in spinning were to prolong its existence as caterpillar , it would be a perfect example of a wage-worker  . \
Labour-power was not always a commodity (  merchandise  )  .  Labour was not always wage-labour , i  . e  .  , free labour  .  The slave did not sell his labour-power to the slave-owner , any more than the ox sells his labour to the farmer  .  The slave , together with his labour-power , was sold to his owner once for all  .  He is a commodity that can pass from the hand of one owner to that of another  .  He himself is a commodity , but his labour-power is not his commodity  .  The serf sells only a portion of his labour-power  .  It is not he who receives wages from the owner of the land ; it is rather the owner of the land who receives a tribute from him  .  The serf belongs to the soil , and to the lord of the soil he brings its fruit  .  The free labourer , on the other hand , sells his very self , and that by fractions  .  He auctions off eight , 10 , 12 , 15 hours of his life , one day like the next , to the highest bidder , to the owner of raw materials , tools , and the means of life \'96 i  . e  .  , to the capitalist  .  The labourer belongs neither to an owner nor to the soil , but eight , 10 , 12 , 15 hours of his daily life belong to whomsoever buys them  .  The worker leaves the capitalist , to whom he has sold himself , as often as he chooses , and the capitalist discharges him as often as he sees fit , as soon as he no longer gets any use , or not the required use , out of him  .  But the worker , whose only source of income is the sale of his labour-power , cannot leave the whole class of buyers , i  . e  .  , the capitalist class , unless he gives up his own existence  .  He does not belong to this or that capitalist , but to the capitalist class ; and it is for him to find his man \'96 i  . e  .  , to find a buyer in this capitalist class  . \
Before entering more closely upon the relation of capital to wage-labour , we shall present briefly the most general conditions which come into consideration in the determination of wages  . \
Wages , as we have seen , are the price of a certain commodity , labour-power  .  Wages , therefore , are determined by the same laws that determine the price of every other commodity  .  The question then is , How is the price of a commodity determined  ?\
By the competition between buyers and sellers , by the relation of the demand to the supply , of the call to the offer  .  The competition by which the price of a commodity is determined is threefold  . \
The same commodity is offered for sale by various sellers  .  Whoever sells commodities of the same quality most cheaply , is sure to drive the other sellers from the field and to secure the greatest market for himself  .  The sellers therefore fight among themselves for the sales , for the market  .  Each one of them wishes to sell , and to sell as much as possible , and if possible to sell alone , to the exclusion of all other sellers  .  Each one sells cheaper than the other  .  Thus there takes place a competition among the sellers which forces down the price of the commodities offered by them  . \
But there is also a competition among the buyers ; this upon its side causes the price of the proffered commodities to rise  . \
Finally , there is competition between the buyers and the sellers  : these wish to purchase as cheaply as possible , those to sell as dearly as possible  .  The result of this competition between buyers and sellers will depend upon the relations between the two above-mentioned camps of competitors \'96 i  . e  .  , upon whether the competition in the army of sellers is stronger  .  Industry leads two great armies into the field against each other , and each of these again is engaged in a battle among its own troops in its own ranks  .  The army among whose troops there is less fighting , carries off the victory over the opposing host  . \
Let us suppose that there are 100 bales of cotton in the market and at the same time purchasers for 1 ,000 bales of cotton  .  In this case , the demand is 10 times greater than the supply  .  Competition among the buyers , then , will be very strong ; each of them tries to get hold of one bale , if possible , of the whole 100 bales  .  This example is no arbitrary supposition  .  In the history of commerce we have experienced periods of scarcity of cotton , when some capitalists united together and sought to buy up not 100 bales , but the whole cotton supply of the world  .  In the given case , then , one buyer seeks to drive the others from the field by offering a relatively higher price for the bales of cotton  .  The cotton sellers , who perceive the troops of the enemy in the most violent contention among themselves , and who therefore are fully assured of the sale of their whole 100 bales , will beware of pulling one another's hair in order to force down the price of cotton at the very moment in which their opponents race with one another to screw it up high  .  So , all of a sudden , peace reigns in the army of sellers  .  They stand opposed to the buyers like one man , fold their arms in philosophic contentment and their claims would find no limit did not the offers of even the most importunate of buyers have a very definite limit  . \
If , then , the supply of a commodity is less than the demand for it , competition among the sellers is very slight , or there may be none at all among them  .  In the same proportion in which this competition decreases , the competition among the buyers increases  .  Result  : a more or less considerable rise in the prices of commodities  . \
It is well known that the opposite case , with the opposite result , happens more frequently  .  Great excess of supply over demand ; desperate competition among the sellers , and a lack of buyers ; forced sales of commodities at ridiculously low prices  . \
But what is a rise , and what a fall of prices  ? What is a high and what a low price  ? A grain of sand is high when examined through a microscope , and a tower is low when compared with a mountain  .  And if the price is determined by the relation of supply and demand , by what is the relation of supply and demand determined  ?\
Let us turn to the first worthy citizen we meet  .  He will not hesitate one moment , but , like Alexander the Great , will cut this metaphysical knot with his multiplication table  .  He will say to us  :   "  If the production of the commodities which I sell has cost me 100 pounds , and out of the sale of these goods I make 110 pounds \'96 within the year , you understand \'96 that's an honest , sound , reasonable profit  .  But if in the exchange I receive 120 or 130 pounds , that's a higher profit ; and if I should get as much as 200 pounds , that would be an extraordinary , and enormous profit  .   "   What is it , then , that serves this citizen as the standard of his profit  ? The cost of the production of his commodities  .  If in exchange for these goods he receives a quantity of other goods whose production has cost less , he has lost  .  If he receives in exchange for his goods a quantity of other goods whose production has cost more , he has gained  .  And he reckons the falling or rising of the profit according to the degree at which the exchange value of his goods stands , whether above or below his zero \'96 the cost of production  . \
We have seen how the changing relation of supply and demand causes now a rise , now a fall of prices ; now high , now low prices  .  If the price of a commodity rises considerably owing to a failing supply or a disproportionately growing demand , then the price of some other commodity must have fallen in proportion ; for of course the price of a commodity only expresses in money the proportion in which other commodities will be given in exchange for it  .  If , for example , the price of a yard of silk rises from two to three shillings , the price of silver has fallen in relation to the silk , and in the same way the prices of all other commodities whose prices have remained stationary have fallen in relation to the price of silk  .  A large quantity of them must be given in exchange in order to obtain the same amount of silk  .  Now , what will be the consequence of a rise in the price of a particular commodity  ? A mass of capital will be thrown into the prosperous branch of industry , and this immigration of capital into the provinces of the favored industry will continue until it yields no more than the customary profits , or , rather until the price of its products , owning to overproduction , sinks below the cost of production  . \
Conversely  : if the price of a commodity falls below its cost of production , then capital will be withdrawn from the production of this commodity  .  Except in the case of a branch of industry which has become obsolete and is therefore doomed to disappear , the production of such a commodity (  that is , its supply  ) , will , owning to this flight of capital , continue to decrease until it corresponds to the demand , and the price of the commodity rises again to the level of its cost of production ; or , rather , until the supply has fallen below the demand and its price has risen above its cost of production , for the current price of a commodity is always either above or below its cost of production  . \
We see how capital continually emigrates out of the province of one industry and immigrates into that of another  .  The high price produces an excessive immigration , and the low price an excessive emigration  . \
We could show , from another point of view , how not only the supply , but also the demand , is determined by the cost of production  .  But this would lead us too far away from our subject  . \
We have just seen how the fluctuation of supply and demand always bring the price of a commodity back to its cost of production  .  The actual price of a commodity , indeed , stands always above or below the cost of production ; but the rise and fall reciprocally balance each other , so that , within a certain period of time , if the ebbs and flows of the industry are reckoned up together , the commodities will be exchanged for one another in accordance with their cost of production  .  Their price is thus determined by their cost of production  . \
The determination of price by the cost of production is not to be understood in the sense of the bourgeois economists  .  The economists say that the average price of commodities equals the cost of production  : that is the law  .  The anarchic movement , in which the rise is compensated for by a fall and the fall by a rise , they regard as an accident  .  We might just as well consider the fluctuations as the law , and the determination of the price by cost of production as an accident \'96 as is , in fact , done by certain other economists  .  But it is precisely these fluctuations which , viewed more closely , carry the most frightful devastation in their train , and , like an earthquake , cause bourgeois society to shake to its very foundations \'96 it is precisely these fluctuations that force the price to conform to the cost of production  .  In the totality of this disorderly movement is to be found its order  .  In the total course of this industrial anarchy , in this circular movement , competition balances , as it were , the one extravagance by the other  . \
We thus see that the price of a commodity is indeed determined by its cost of production , but in such a manner that the periods in which the price of these commodities rises above the costs of production are balanced by the periods in which it sinks below the cost of production , and vice versa  .  Of course this does not hold good for a single given product of an industry , but only for that branch of industry  .  So also it does not hold good for an individual manufacturer , but only for the whole class of manufacturers  . \
The determination of price by cost of production is tantamount to the determination of price by the labor-time requisite to the production of a commodity , for the cost of production consists , first of raw materials and wear and tear of tools , etc  .  , i  . e  .  , of industrial products whose production has cost a certain number of work-days , which therefore represent a certain amount of labor-time , and , secondly , of direct labor , which is also measured by its duration  . \
Now , the same general laws which regulate the price of commodities in general , naturally regulate wages , or the price of labour-power  .  Wages will now rise , now fall , according to the relation of supply and demand , according as competition shapes itself between the buyers of labour-power , the capitalists , and the sellers of labour-power , the workers  .  The fluctuations of wages correspond to the fluctuation in the price of commodities in general  .  But within the limits of these fluctuations the price of labour-power will be determined by the cost of production , by the labour-time necessary for production of this commodity  : labour-power  . \
What , then , is the cost of production of labour-power  ?\
It is the cost required for the maintenance of the labourer as a labourer , and for his education and training as a labourer  . \
Therefore , the shorter the time required for training up to a particular sort of work , the smaller is the cost of production of the worker , the lower is the price of his labour-power , his wages  .  In those branches of industry in which hardly any period of apprenticeship is necessary and the mere bodily existence of the worker is sufficient , the cost of his production is limited almost exclusively to the commodities necessary for keeping him in working condition  .  The price of his work will therefore be determined by the price of the necessary means of subsistence  . \
Here , however , there enters another consideration  .  The manufacturer who calculates his cost of production and , in accordance with it , the price of the product , takes into account the wear and tear of the instruments of labour  .  If a machine costs him , for example , 1 ,000 shillings , and this machine is used up in 10 years , he adds 100 shillings annually to the price of the commodities , in order to be able after 10 years to replace the worn-out machine with a new one  .  In the same manner , the cost of production of simple labour-power must include the cost of propagation , by means of which the race of workers is enabled to multiply itself , and to replace worn-out workers with new ones  .  The wear and tear of the worker , therefore , is calculated in the same manner as the wear and tear of the machine  . \
Thus , the cost of production of simple labour-power amounts to the cost of the existence and propagation of the worker  .  The price of this cost of existence and propagation constitutes wages  .  The wages thus determined are called the minimum of wages  .  This minimum wage , like the determination of the price of commodities in general by cost of production , does not hold good for the single individual , but only for the race  .  Individual workers , indeed , millions of workers , do not receive enough to be able to exist and to propagate themselves ; but the wages of the whole working class adjust themselves , within the limits of their fluctuations , to this minimum  . \
Now that we have come to an understanding in regard to the most general laws which govern wages , as well as the price of every other commodity , we can examine our subject more particularly  . \
\
\
\
Capital consists of raw materials , instruments of labour , and means of subsistence of all kinds , which are employed in producing new raw materials , new instruments , and new means of subsistence  .  All these components of capital are created by labour , products of labour , accumulated labour  .  Accumulated labour that serves as a means to new production is capital  . \
So say the economists  . \
What is a Negro slave  ? A man of the black race  .  The one explanation is worthy of the other  . \
A Negro is a Negro  .  Only under certain conditions does he become a slave  .  A cotton-spinning machine is a machine for spinning cotton  .  Only under certain conditions does it become capital  .  Torn away from these conditions , it is as little capital as gold is itself money , or sugar is the price of sugar  . \
In the process of production , human beings work not only upon nature , but also upon one another  .  They produce only by working together in a specified manner and reciprocally exchanging their activities  .  In order to produce , they enter into definite connections and relations to one another , and only within these social connections and relations does their influence upon nature operate \'96 i  . e  .  , does production take place  . \
These social relations between the producers , and the conditions under which they exchange their activities and share in the total act of production , will naturally vary according to the character of the means of production  .  With the discover of a new instrument of warfare , the firearm , the whole internal organization of the army was necessarily altered , the relations within which individuals compose an army and can work as an army were transformed , and the relation of different armies to another was likewise changed  . \
We thus see that the social relations within which individuals produce , the social relations of production , are altered , transformed , with the change and development of the material means of production , of the forces of production  .  The relations of production in their totality constitute what is called the social relations , society , and , moreover , a society at a definite stage of historical development , a society with peculiar , distinctive characteristics  .  Ancient society , feudal society , bourgeois (  or capitalist  ) society , are such totalities of relations of production , each of which denotes a particular stage of development in the history of mankind  . \
Capital also is a social relation of production  .  It is a bourgeois relation of production , a relation of production of bourgeois society  .  The means of subsistence , the instruments of labour , the raw materials , of which capital consists \'96 have they not been produced and accumulated under given social conditions , within definite special relations  ? Are they not employed for new production , under given special conditions , within definite social relations  ? And does not just the definite social character stamp the products which serve for new production as capital  ?\
Capital consists not only of means of subsistence , instruments of labour , and raw materials , not only as material products ; it consists just as much of exchange values  .  All products of which it consists are commodities  .  Capital , consequently , is not only a sum of material products , it is a sum of commodities , of exchange values , of social magnitudes  .  Capital remains the same whether we put cotton in the place of wool , rice in the place of wheat , steamships in the place of railroads , provided only that the cotton , the rice , the steamships \'96 the body of capital \'96 have the same exchange value , the same price , as the wool , the wheat , the railroads , in which it was previously embodied  .  The bodily form of capital may transform itself continually , while capital does not suffer the least alteration  . \
But though every capital is a sum of commodities \'96 i  . e  .  , of exchange values \'96 it does not follow that every sum of commodities , of exchange values , is capital  . \
Every sum of exchange values is an exchange value  .  Each particular exchange value is a sum of exchange values  .  For example  : a house worth 1 ,000 pounds is an exchange value of 1 ,000 pounds  : a piece of paper worth one penny is a sum of exchange values of 100 1/100ths of a penny  .  Products which are exchangeable for others are commodities  .  The definite proportion in which they are exchangeable forms their exchange value , or , expressed in money , their price  .  The quantity of these products can have no effect on their character as commodities , as representing an exchange value  , as having a certain price  .  Whether a tree be large or small , it remains a tree  .  Whether we exchange iron in pennyweights or in hundredweights , for other products , does this alter its character  : its being a commodity , or exchange value  ? According to the quantity , it is a commodity of greater or of lesser value , of higher or of lower price  . \
How then does a sum of commodities , of exchange values , become capital  ?\
Thereby , that as an independent social power \'96 i  . e  .  , as the power of a part of society \'96 it preserves itself and multiplies by exchange with direct , living labour-power  . \
The existence of a class which possesses nothing but the ability to work is a necessary presupposition of capital  . \
It is only the dominion of past , accumulated , materialized labour over immediate living labour that stamps the accumulated labour with the character of capital  . \
Capital does not consist in the fact that accumulated labour serves living labour as a means for new production  .  It consists in the fact that living labour serves accumulated labour as the means of preserving and multiplying its exchange value  . \
What is it that takes place in the exchange between the capitalist and the wage-labourer  ?\
The labourer receives means of subsistence in exchange for his labour-power ; the capitalist receives , in exchange for his means of subsistence , labour , the productive activity of the labourer , the creative force by which the worker not only replaces what he consumes , but also gives to the accumulated labour a greater value than it previously possessed  .  The labourer gets from the capitalist a portion of the existing means of subsistence  .  For what purpose do these means of subsistence serve him  ? For immediate consumption  .  But as soon as I consume means of subsistence , they are irrevocably lost to me , unless I employ the time during which these means sustain my life in producing new means of subsistence , in creating by my labour new values in place of the values lost in consumption  .  But it is just this noble reproductive power that the labourer surrenders to the capitalist in exchange for means of subsistence received  .  Consequently , he has lost it for himself  . \
Let us take an example  .  For one shilling a labourer works all day long in the fields of a farmer , to whom he thus secures a return of two shillings  .  The farmer not only receives the replaced value which he has given to the day labourer , he has doubled it  .  Therefore , he has consumed the one shilling that he gave to the day labourer in a fruitful , productive manner  .  For the one shilling he has bought the labour-power of the day-labourer , which creates products of the soil of twice the value , and out of one shilling makes two  .  The day-labourer , on the contrary , receives in the place of his productive force , whose results he has just surrendered to the farmer , one shilling , which he exchanges for means of subsistence , which he consumes more or less quickly  .  The one shilling has therefore been consumed in a double manner \'96 reproductively for the capitalist , for it has been exchanged for labour-power , which brought forth two shillings ; unproductively for the worker , for it has been exchanged for means of subsistence which are lost for ever , and whose value he can obtain again only by repeating the same exchange with the farmer  .  Capital therefore presupposes wage-labour ; wage-labour presupposes capital  .  They condition each other ; each brings the other into existence  . \
Does a worker in a cotton factory produce only cotton  ? No  .  He produces capital  .  He produces values which serve anew to command his work and to create by means of it new values  . \
Capital can multiply itself only by exchanging itself for labour-power , by calling wage-labour into life  .  The labour-power of the wage-labourer can exchange itself for capital only by increasing capital , by strengthening that very power whose slave it is  .  Increase of capital , therefore , is increase of the proletariat , i  . e  .  , of the working class  . \
And so , the bourgeoisie and its economists maintain that the interest of the capitalist and of the labourer is the same  .  And in fact , so they are  ! The worker perishes if capital does not keep him busy  .  Capital perishes if it does not exploit labour-power , which , in order to exploit , it must buy  .  The more quickly the capital destined for production \'96 the productive capital \'96 increases , the more prosperous industry is , the more the bourgeoisie enriches itself , the better business gets , so many more workers does the capitalist need , so much the dearer does the worker sell himself  .  The fastest possible growth of productive capital is , therefore , the indispensable condition for a tolerable life to the labourer  . \
But what is growth of productive capital  ? Growth of the power of accumulated labour over living labour ; growth of the rule of the bourgeoisie over the working class  .  When wage-labour produces the alien wealth dominating it , the power hostile to it , capital , there flow back to it its means of employment \'96 i  . e  .  , its means of subsistence , under the condition that it again become a part of capital , that is become again the lever whereby capital is to be forced into an accelerated expansive movement  . \
To say that the interests of capital and the interests of the workers are identical , signifies only this  : that capital and wage-labour are two sides of one and the same relation  .  The one conditions the other in the same way that the usurer and the borrower condition each other  . \
As long as the wage-labourer remains a wage-labourer , his lot is dependent upon capital  .  That is what the boasted community of interests between worker and capitalists amounts to  . \
If capital grows , the mass of wage-labour grows , the number of wage-workers increases ; in a word , the sway of capital extends over a greater mass of individuals  . \
Let us suppose the most favorable case  : if productive capital grows , the demand for labour grows  .  It therefore increases the price of labour-power , wages  . \
A house may be large or small ; as long as the neighboring houses are likewise small , it satisfies all social requirement for a residence  .  But let there arise next to the little house a palace , and the little house shrinks to a hut  .  The little house now makes it clear that its inmate has no social position at all to maintain , or but a very insignificant one ; and however high it may shoot up in the course of civilization , if the neighboring palace rises in equal or even in greater measure , the occupant of the relatively little house will always find himself more uncomfortable , more dissatisfied , more cramped within his four walls  . \
An appreciable rise in wages presupposes a rapid growth of productive capital  .  Rapid growth of productive capital calls forth just as rapid a growth of wealth , of luxury , of social needs and social pleasures  .  Therefore , although the pleasures of the labourer have increased , the social gratification which they afford has fallen in comparison with the increased pleasures of the capitalist , which are inaccessible to the worker , in comparison with the stage of development of society in general  .  Our wants and pleasures have their origin in society ; we therefore measure them in relation to society ; we do not measure them in relation to the objects which serve for their gratification  .  Since they are of a social nature , they are of a relative nature  . \
But wages are not at all determined merely by the sum of commodities for which they may be exchanged  .  Other factors enter into the problem  .  What the workers directly receive for their labour-power is a certain sum of money  .  Are wages determined merely by this money price  ?\
In the 16th century , the gold and silver circulation in Europe increased in consequence of the discovery of richer and more easily worked mines in America  .  The value of gold and silver , therefore , fell in relation to other commodities  .  The workers received the same amount of coined silver for their labour-power as before  .  The money price of their work remained the same , and yet their wages had fallen , for in exchange for the same amount of silver they obtained a smaller amount of other commodities  .  This was one of the circumstances which furthered the growth of capital , the rise of the bourgeoisie , in the 18th century  . \
Let us take another case  .  In the winter of 1847 , in consequence of bad harvest , the most indispensable means of subsistence \'96 grains , meat , butter , cheese , etc  .  \'96 rose greatly in price  .  Let us suppose that the workers still received the same sum of money for their labour-power as before  .  Did not their wages fall  ? To be sure  .  For the same money they received in exchange less bread , meat , etc  .  Their wages fell , not because the value of silver was less , but because the value of the means of subsistence had increased  . \
Finally , let us suppose that the money price of labour-power remained the same , while all agricultural and manufactured commodities had fallen in price because of the employment of new machines , of favorable seasons , etc  .  For the same money the workers could now buy more commodities of all kinds  .  Their wages have therefore risen , just because their money value has not changed  . \
The money price of labour-power , the nominal wages , do not therefore coincide with the actual or real wages \'96 i  . e  .  , with the amount of commodities which are actually given in exchange for the wages  .  If then we speak of a rise or fall of wages , we have to keep in mind not only the money price of labour-power , the nominal wages , but also the real wages  . \
But neither the nominal wages \'96 i  . e  .  , the amount of money for which the labourer sells himself to the capitalist \'96 nor the real wages \'96 i  . e  .  , the amount of commodities which he can buy for this money \'96 exhausts the relations which are comprehended in the term wages  . \
Wages are determined above all by their relations to the gain , the profit , of the capitalist  .  In other words , wages are a proportionate , relative quantity  . \
Real wages express the price of labour-power in relation to the price of commodities ; relative wages , on the other hand , express the share of immediate labour in the value newly created by it , in relation to the share of it which falls to accumulated labour , to capital  . \
We have said  :   "  Wages are not a share of the worker in the commodities produced by him  .  Wages are that part of already existing commodities with which the capitalist buys a certain amount of productive labor-power  .   "   But the capitalist must replace these wages out of the price for which he sells the product made by the worker ; he must so replace it that , as a rule , there remains to him a surplus above the cost of production expended by him , that is , he must get a profit  . \
The selling price of the commodities produced by the worker is divided , from the point of view of the capitalist , into three parts  :\
First , the replacement of the price of the raw materials advanced by him , in addition to the replacement of the wear and tear of the tools , machines , and other instruments of labor likewise advanced by him ;\
Second , the replacement of the wages advanced ; and\
Third , the surplus leftover \'96 i  . e  .  , the profit of the capitalist  . \
While the first part merely replaces previously existing values , it is evident that the replacement of the wages and the surplus (  the profit of capital  ) are as a whole taken out of the new value , which is produced by the labor of the worker and added to the raw materials  .  And in this sense we can view wages as well as profit , for the purpose of comparing them with each other , as shares in the product of the worker  . \
Real wages may remain the same , they may even rise , nevertheless the relative wages may fall  .  Let us suppose , for instance , that all means of subsistence have fallen 2/3rds in price , while the day's wages have fallen but 1/3rd \'96 for example , from three to two shillings  .  Although the worker can now get a greater amount of commodities with these two shillings than he formerly did with three shillings , yet his wages have decreased in proportion to the gain of the capitalist  .  The profit of the capitalist \'96 the manufacturer's for instance \'96 has increased one shilling , which means that for a smaller amount of exchange values , which he pays to the worker , the latter must produce a greater amount of exchange values than before  .  The share of capitals in proportion to the share of labour has risen  .  The distribution of social wealth between capital and labour has become still more unequal  .  The capitalist commands a greater amount of labour with the same capital  .  The power of the capitalist class over the working class has grown , the social position of the worker has become worse , has been forced down still another degree below that of the capitalist  . \
What , then , is the general law that determines the rise and fall of wages and profit in their reciprocal relation  ?\
They stand in inverse proportion to each other  .  The share of (  profit  ) increases in the same proportion in which the share of labour (  wages  ) falls , and vice versa  .  Profit rises in the same degree in which wages fall ; it falls in the same degree in which wages rise  . \
It might perhaps be argued that the capitalist class can gain by an advantageous exchange of his products with other capitalists , by a rise in the demand for his commodities , whether in consequence of the opening up of new markets , or in consequence of temporarily increased demands in the old market , and so on ; that the profit of the capitalist , therefore , may be multiplied by taking advantage of other capitalists , independently of the rise and fall of wages , of the exchange value of labour-power ; or that the profit of the capitalist may also rise through improvements in the instruments of labour , new applications of the forces of nature , and so on  . \
But in the first place it must be admitted that the result remains the same , although brought about in an opposite manner  .  Profit , indeed , has not risen because wages have fallen , but wages have fallen because profit has risen  .  With the same amount of another man's labour the capitalist has bought a larger amount of exchange values without having paid more for the labour on that account \'96 i  . e  .  , the work is paid for less in proportion to the net gain which it yields to the capitalist  . \
In the second place , it must be borne in mind that , despite the fluctuations in the prices of commodities , the average price of every commodity , the proportion in which it exchanges for other commodities , is determined by its cost of production  .  The acts of overreaching and taking advantage of one another within the capitalist ranks necessarily equalize themselves  .  The improvements of machinery , the new applications of the forces of nature in the service of production , make it possible to produce in a given period of time , with the same amount of labour and capital , a larger amount of products , but in no wise a larger amount of exchange values  .  If by the use of the spinning-machine I can furnish twice as much yarn in an hour as before its invention \'96 for instance , 100 pounds instead of 50 pounds \'96 in the long run I receive back , in exchange for this 100 pounds no more commodities than I did before for 50 ; because the cost of production has fallen by 1/2 , or because I can furnish double the product at the same cost  . \
Finally , in whatsoever proportion the capitalist class , whether of one country or of the entire world-market , distribute the net revenue of production among themselves , the total amount of this net revenue always consists exclusively of the amount by which accumulated labour has been increased from the proceeds of direct labour  .  This whole amount , therefore , grows in the same proportion in which labour augments capital \'96 i  . e  .  , in the same proportion in which profit rises as compared with wages  . \
We thus see that , even if we keep ourselves within the relation of capital and wage-labour , the interests of capitals and the interests of wage-labour are diametrically opposed to each other  . \
A rapid growth of capital is synonymous with a rapid growth of profits  .  Profits can grow rapidly only when the price of labour \'96 the relative wages \'96 decrease just as rapidly  .  Relative wages may fall , although real wages rise simultaneously with nominal wages , with the money value of labour , provided only that the real wage does not rise in the same proportion as the profit  .  If , for instance , in good business years wages rise 5 per cent , while profits rise 30 per cent , the proportional , the relative wage has not increased , but decreased  . \
If , therefore , the income of the worker increased with the rapid growth of capital , there is at the same time a widening of the social chasm that divides the worker from the capitalist , and increase in the power of capital over labour , a greater dependence of labour upon capital  . \
To say that   "  the worker has an interest in the rapid growth of capital  "   , means only this  : that the more speedily the worker augments the wealth of the capitalist , the larger will be the crumbs which fall to him , the greater will be the number of workers than can be called into existence , the more can the mass of slaves dependent upon capital be increased  . \
We have thus seen that even the most favorable situation for the working class , namely , the most rapid growth of capital , however much it may improve the material life of the worker , does not abolish the antagonism between his interests and the interests of the capitalist  .  Profit and wages remain as before , in inverse proportion  . \
If capital grows rapidly , wages may rise , but the profit of capital rises disproportionately faster  .  The material position of the worker has improved , but at the cost of his social position  .  The social chasm that separates him from the capitalist has widened  . \
Finally , to say that   "  the most favorable condition for wage-labour is the fastest possible growth of productive capital  "   , is the same as to say  : the quicker the working class multiplies and augments the power inimical to it \'96 the wealth of another which lords over that class \'96 the more favorable will be the conditions under which it will be permitted to toil anew at the multiplication of bourgeois wealth , at the enlargement of the power of capital , content thus to forge for itself the golden chains by which the bourgeoisie drags it in its train  . \
Growth of productive capital and rise of wages , are they really so indissolubly united as the bourgeois economists maintain  ? We must not believe their mere words  .  We dare not believe them even when they claim that the fatter capital is the more will its slave be pampered  .  The bourgeoisie is too much enlightened , it keeps its accounts much too carefully , to share the prejudices of the feudal lord , who makes an ostentatious display of the magnificence of his retinue  .  The conditions of existence of the bourgeoisie compel it to attend carefully to its bookkeeping  .  We must therefore examine more closely into the following question  :\
In what manner does the growth of productive capital affect wages  ?\
If as a whole , the productive capital of bourgeois society grows , there takes place a more many-sided accumulation of labour  .  The individual capitals increase in number and in magnitude  .  The multiplications of individual capitals increases the competition among capitalists  .  The increasing magnitude of increasing capitals provides the means of leading more powerful armies of workers with more gigantic instruments of war upon the industrial battlefield  . \
The one capitalist can drive the other from the field and carry off his capital only by selling more cheaply  .  In order to sell more cheaply without ruining himself , he must produce more cheaply \'96 i  . e  .  , increase the productive forces of labour as much as possible  . \
But the productive forces of labour is increased above all by a greater division of labour and by a more general introduction and constant improvement of machinery  .  The larger the army of workers among whom the labour is subdivided , the more gigantic the scale upon which machinery is introduced , the more in proportion does the cost of production decrease , the more fruitful is the labour  .  And so there arises among the capitalists a universal rivalry for the increase of the division of labour and of machinery and for their exploitation upon the greatest possible scale  . \
If , now , by a greater division of labour , by the application and improvement of new machines , by a more advantageous exploitation of the forces of nature on a larger scale , a capitalist has found the means of producing with the same amount of labour (  whether it be direct or accumulated labour  ) a larger amount of products of commodities than his competitors \'96 if , for instance , he can produce a whole yard of linen in the same labour-time in which his competitors weave half-a-yard \'96 how will this capitalist act  ?\
He could keep on selling half-a-yard of linen at old market price ; but this would not have the effect of driving his opponents from the field and enlarging his own market  .  But his need of a market has increased in the same measure in which his productive power has extended  .  The more powerful and costly means of production that he has called into existence enable him , it is true , to sell his wares more cheaply , but they compel him at the same time to sell more wares , to get control of a very much greater market for his commodities ; consequently , this capitalist will sell his half-yard of linen more cheaply than his competitors  . \
But the capitalist will not sell the whole yard so cheaply as his competitors sell the half-yard , although the production of the whole yard costs him no more than does that of the half-yard to the others  .  Otherwise , he would make no extra profit , and would get back in exchange only the cost of production  .  He might obtain a greater income from having set in motion a larger capital , but not from having made a greater profit on his capital than the others  .  Moreover , he attains the object he is aiming at if he prices his goods only a small percentage lower than his competitors  .  He drives them off the field , he wrests from them at least part of their market , by underselling them  . \
And finally , let us remember that the current price always stands either above or below the cost of production , according as the sale of a commodity takes place in the favorable or unfavorable period of the industry  .  According as the market price of the yard of linen stands above or below its former cost of production , will the percentage vary at which the capitalist who has made use of the new and more faithful means of production sell above his real cost of production  . \
But the privilege of our capitalist is not of long duration  .  Other competing capitalists introduce the same machines , the same division of labour , and introduce them upon the same or even upon a greater scale  .  And finally this introduction becomes so universal that the price of the linen is lowered not only below its old , but even below its new cost of production  . \
The capitalists therefore find themselves , in their mutual relations , in the same situation in which they were before the introduction of the new means of production ; and if they are by these means enabled to offer double the product at the old price , they are now forced to furnish double the product for less than the old price  .  Having arrived at the new point , the new cost of production , the battle for supremacy in the market has to be fought out anew  .  Given more division of labour and more machinery , and there results a greater scale upon which division of labour and machinery are exploited  .  And competition again brings the same reaction against this result  . \
We thus see how the method of production and the means of production are constantly enlarged , revolutionized , how division of labour necessarily draws after it greater division of labour , the employment of machinery greater employment of machinery , work upon a large scale work upon a still greater scale  .  This is the law that continually throws capitalist production out of its old ruts and compels capital to strain ever more the productive forces of labour for the very reason that it has already strained them \'96 the law that grants it no respite , and constantly shouts in its ear  : March  ! march  ! This is no other law than that which , within the periodical fluctuations of commerce , necessarily adjusts the price of a commodity to its cost of production  . \
No matter how powerful the means of production which a capitalist may bring into the field , competition will make their adoption general ; and from the moment that they have been generally adopted , the sole result of the greater productiveness of his capital will be that he must furnish at the same price , 10 , 20 , 100 times as much as before  .  But since he must find a market for , perhaps , 1 ,000 times as much , in order to outweigh the lower selling price by the greater quantity of the sale ; since now a more extensive sale is necessary not only to gain a greater profit , but also in order to replace the cost of production (  the instrument of production itself grows always more costly , as we have seen  ) , and since this more extensive sale has become a question of life and death not only for him , but also for his rivals , the old struggle must begin again , and it is all the more violent the more powerful the means of production already invented are  .  The division of labour and the application of machinery will therefore take a fresh start , and upon an even greater scale  . \
Whatever be the power of the means of production which are employed , competition seeks to rob capital of the golden fruits of this power by reducing the price of commodities to the cost of production ; in the same measure in which production is cheapened - i  . e  .  , in the same measure in which more can be produced with the same amount of labour \'96 it compels by a law which is irresistible a still greater cheapening of production , the sale of ever greater masses of product for smaller prices  .  Thus the capitalist will have gained nothing more by his efforts than the obligation to furnish a greater product in the same labour-time ; in a word , more difficult conditions for the profitable employment of his capital  .  While competition , therefore , constantly pursues him with its law of the cost of production and turns against himself every weapon that he forges against his rivals , the capitalist continually seeks to get the best of competition by restlessly introducing further subdivision of labour and new machines , which , though more expensive , enable him to produce more cheaply , instead of waiting until the new machines shall have been rendered obsolete by competition  . \
If we now conceive this feverish agitation as it operates in the market of the whole world , we shall be in a position to comprehend how the growth , accumulation , and concentration of capital bring in their train an ever more detailed subdivision of labour , an ever greater improvement of old machines , and a constant application of new machine \'96 a process which goes on uninterruptedly , with feverish haste , and upon an ever more gigantic scale  . \
But what effect do these conditions , which are inseparable from the growth of productive capital , have upon the determination of wages  ?\
The greater division of labour enables one labourer to accomplish the work of five , 10 , or 20 labourers ; it therefore increases competition among the labourers fivefold , tenfold , or twentyfold  .  The labourers compete not only by selling themselves one cheaper than the other , but also by one doing the work of five , 10 , or 20 ; and they are forced to compete in this manner by the division of labour , which is introduced and steadily improved by capital  . \
Furthermore , to the same degree in which the division of labour increases , is the labour simplified  .  The special skill of the labourer becomes worthless  .  He becomes transformed into a simple monotonous force of production , with neither physical nor mental elasticity  .  His work becomes accessible to all ; therefore competitors press upon him from all sides  .  Moreover , it must be remembered that the more simple , the more easily learned the work is , so much the less is its cost to production , the expense of its acquisition , and so much the lower must the wages sink \'96 for , like the price of any other commodity , they are determined by the cost of production  .  Therefore , in the same manner in which labour becomes more unsatisfactory , more repulsive , do competition increase and wages decrease  . \
The labourer seeks to maintain the total of his wages for a given time by performing more labour , either by working a great number of hours , or by accomplishing more in the same number of hours  .  Thus , urged on by want , he himself multiplies the disastrous effects of division of labour  .  The result is  : the more he works , the less wages he receives  .  And for this simple reason  : the more he works , the more he competes against his fellow workmen , the more he compels them to compete against him , and to offer themselves on the same wretched conditions as he does ; so that , in the last analysis , he competes against himself as a member of the working class  . \
Machinery produces the same effects , but upon a much larger scale  .  It supplants skilled labourers by unskilled , men by women , adults by children ; where newly introduced , it throws workers upon the streets in great masses ; and as it becomes more highly developed and more productive it discards them in additional though smaller numbers  . \
We have hastily sketched in broad outlines the industrial war of capitalists among themselves  .  This war has the peculiarity that the battles in it are won less by recruiting than by discharging the army of workers  .  The generals (  the capitalists  ) vie with one another as to who can discharge the greatest number of industrial soldiers  . \
The economists tell us , to be sure , that those labourers who have been rendered superfluous by machinery find new venues of employment  .  They dare not assert directly that the same labourers that have been discharged find situations in new branches of labour  .  Facts cry out too loudly against this lie  .  Strictly speaking , they only maintain that new means of employment will be found for other sections of the working class ; for example , for that portion of the young generation of labourers who were about to enter upon that branch of industry which had just been abolished  .  Of course , this is a great satisfaction to the disabled labourers  .  There will be no lack of fresh exploitable blood and muscle for the Messrs  .  Capitalists \'96 the dead may bury their dead  .  This consolation seems to be intended more for the comfort of the capitalists themselves than their labourers  .  If the whole class of the wage-labourer were to be annihilated by machinery , how terrible that would be for capital , which , without wage-labour , ceases to be capital  !\
But even if we assume that all who are directly forced out of employment by machinery , as well as all of the rising generation who were waiting for a chance of employment in the same branch of industry , do actually find some new employment \'96 are we to believe that this new employment will pay as high wages as did the one they have lost  ? If it did , it would be in contradiction to the laws of political economy  .  We have seen how modern industry always tends to the substitution of the simpler and more subordinate employments for the higher and more complex ones  .  How , then , could a mass of workers thrown out of one branch of industry by machinery find refuge in another branch , unless they were to be paid more poorly  ?\
An exception to the law has been adduced , namely , the workers who are employed in the manufacture of machinery itself  .  As soon as there is in industry a greater demand for and a greater consumption of machinery , it is said that the number of machines must necessarily increase ; consequently , also , the manufacture of machines ; consequently , also , the employment of workers in machine manufacture ; and the workers employed in this branch of industry are skilled , even educated , workers  . \
Since the year 1840 this assertion , which even before that date was only half-true , has lost all semblance of truth ; for the most diverse machines are now applied to the manufacture of the machines themselves on quite as extensive a scale as in the manufacture of cotton yarn , and the labourers employed in machine factories can but play the role of very stupid machines alongside of the highly ingenious machines  . \
But in place of the man who has been dismissed by the machine , the factory may employ , perhaps , three children and one woman  ! And must not the wages of the man have previously sufficed for the three children and one woman  ? Must not the minimum wages have sufficed for the preservation and propagation of the race  ? What , then , do these beloved bourgeois phrases prove  ? Nothing more than that now four times as many workers' lives are used up as there were previously , in order to obtain the livelihood of one working family  . \
To sum up  : the more productive capital grows , the more it extends the division of labour and the application of machinery ; the more the division of labour and the application of machinery extend , the more does competition extend among the workers , the more do their wages shrink together  . \
In addition , the working class is also recruited from the higher strata of society ; a mass of small business men and of people living upon the interest of their capitals is precipitated into the ranks of the working class , and they will have nothing else to do than to stretch out their arms alongside of the arms of the workers  .  Thus the forest of outstretched arms , begging for work , grows ever thicker , while the arms themselves grow every leaner  . \
It is evident that the small manufacturer cannot survive in a struggle in which the first condition of success is production upon an ever greater scale  .  It is evident that the small manufacturers and thereby increasing the number of candidates for the proletariat \'96 all this requires no further elucidation  . \
Finally , in the same measure in which the capitalists are compelled , by the movement described above , to exploit the already existing gigantic means of production on an ever-increasing scale , and for this purpose to set in motion all the mainsprings of credit , in the same measure do they increase the industrial earthquakes , in the midst of which the commercial world can preserve itself only by sacrificing a portion of its wealth , its products , and even its forces of production , to the gods of the lower world \'96 in short , the crises increase  .  They become more frequent and more violent , if for no other reason , than for this alone , that in the same measure in which the mass of products grows , and therefore the needs for extensive markets , in the same measure does the world market shrink ever more , and ever fewer markets remain to be exploited , since every previous crisis has subjected to the commerce of the world a hitherto unconquered or but superficially exploited market  . \
But capital not only lives upon labour  .  Like a master , at once distinguished and barbarous , it drags with it into its grave the corpses of its slaves , whole hecatombs of workers , who perish in the crises  . \
We thus see that if capital grows rapidly , competition among the workers grows with even greater rapidity \'96 i  . e  .  , the means of employment and subsistence for the working class decrease in proportion even more rapidly ; but , this notwithstanding , the rapid growth of capital is the most favorable condition for wage-labour  . \
In the social\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#production"}}{\fldrslt production}}\'a0of their life , men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/r/e.htm#relations-production"}}{\fldrslt relations of production}}\'a0which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#productive-forces"}}{\fldrslt productive forces}}  .  The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society , the real foundation , on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness  . \
The\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/o.htm#mode-production"}}{\fldrslt mode of production}}\'a0of material life conditions the social , political and intellectual life process in general  .  It is not the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm#consciousness"}}{\fldrslt consciousness}}\'a0of men that determines their being , but , on the contrary , their social being that determines their consciousness  . \
At a certain stage of their development , the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production , or \'97 what is but a legal expression for the same thing \'97 with the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#property"}}{\fldrslt property}}\'a0relations within which they have been at work hitherto  .  From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters  . \
Then begins an epoch of social revolution  .  With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed  .  In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production , which can be determined with the precision of natural science , and the legal , political , religious , aesthetic or philosophic \'97 in short , ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out  .  Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself , so can we not judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness ; on the contrary , this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life , from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production  . \
No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed ; and new , higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself  .  Therefore mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve ; since , looking at the matter more closely , it will always be found that the tasks itself arises only when the material conditions of its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation  . \
In broad outlines Asiatic{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface-abs.htm#e1"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}} , ancient , feudal , and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society  .  The bourgeois relations of production are the last antagonistic form of the social process of production \'97 antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonisms , but of one arising from the social conditions of life of the individuals ; at the same time the productive forces developing in the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the solution of that antagonism  .  This social formation brings , therefore , the prehistory of society to a close  . \
SECTION 1\
THE TWO FACTORS OF A COMMODITY  :\uc0\u8232 USE-VALUE AND VALUE\u8232 (  THE SUBSTANCE OF VALUE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF VALUE  )\
\
\'a0\
The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails , presents itself as \'93an immense accumulation of commodities ,\'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\'a0its unit being a single commodity  .  Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity  . \
A commodity is , in the first place , an object outside us , a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another  .  The nature of such wants , whether , for instance , they spring from the stomach or from fancy , makes no difference  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt  [ 2 ]}}\'a0Neither are we here concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants , whether directly as means of subsistence , or indirectly as means of production  . \
Every useful thing , as iron , paper , &c  .  , may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity  .  It is an assemblage of many properties , and may therefore be of use in various ways  .  To discover the various uses of things is the work of history  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#3"}}{\fldrslt  [ 3 ]}}\'a0So also is the establishment of socially-recognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects  .  The diversity of these measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured , partly in convention  . \
The utility of a thing makes it a use value  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#4"}}{\fldrslt  [ 4 ]}}\'a0But this utility is not a thing of air  .  Being limited by the physical properties of the commodity , it has no existence apart from that commodity  .  A commodity , such as iron , corn , or a diamond , is therefore , so far as it is a material thing , a use value , something useful  .  This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities  .  When treating of use value , we always assume to be dealing with definite quantities , such as dozens of watches , yards of linen , or tons of iron  .  The use values of commodities furnish the material for a special study , that of the commercial knowledge of commodities  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#5"}}{\fldrslt  [ 5 ]}}\'a0Use values become a reality only by use or consumption  : they also constitute the substance of all wealth , whatever may be the social form of that wealth  .  In the form of society we are about to consider , they are , in addition , the material depositories of exchange value  . \
Exchange value , at first sight , presents itself as a quantitative relation , as the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#6"}}{\fldrslt  [ 6 ]}}a relation constantly changing with time and place  .  Hence exchange value appears to be something accidental and purely relative , and consequently an intrinsic value ,\'a0i  . e  .  , an exchange value that is inseparably connected with , inherent in commodities , seems a contradiction in terms  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#7"}}{\fldrslt  [ 7 ]}}\'a0Let us consider the matter a little more closely  . \
A given commodity ,\'a0e  . g  .  , a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking , y silk , or z gold , &c  .  \'96 in short , for other commodities in the most different proportions  .  Instead of one exchange value , the wheat has , therefore , a great many  .  But since x blacking , y silk , or z gold &c  .  , each represents the exchange value of one quarter of wheat , x blacking , y silk , z gold , &c  .  , must , as exchange values , be replaceable by each other , or equal to each other  .  Therefore , first  : the valid exchange values of a given commodity express something equal ; secondly , exchange value , generally , is only the mode of expression , the phenomenal form , of something contained in it , yet distinguishable from it  . \
Let us take two commodities ,\'a0e  . g  .  , corn and iron  .  The proportions in which they are exchangeable , whatever those proportions may be , can always be represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron  :\'a0e  . g  .  , 1 quarter corn = x cwt  .  iron  .  What does this equation tell us  ? It tells us that in two different things \'96 in 1 quarter of corn and x cwt  .  of iron , there exists in equal quantities something common to both  .  The two things must therefore be equal to a third , which in itself is neither the one nor the other  .  Each of them , so far as it is exchange value , must therefore be reducible to this third  . \
A simple geometrical illustration will make this clear  .  In order to calculate and compare the areas of rectilinear figures , we decompose them into triangles  .  But the area of the triangle itself is expressed by something totally different from its visible figure , namely , by half the product of the base multiplied by the altitude  .  In the same way the exchange values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all , of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity  . \
This common \'93something\'94 cannot be either a geometrical , a chemical , or any other natural property of commodities  .  Such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities , make them use values  .  But the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value  .  Then one use value is just as good as another , provided only it be present in sufficient quantity  .  Or , as old Barbon says ,\
\'93one sort of wares are as good as another , if the values be equal  .  There is no difference or distinction in things of equal value   .   .   .  An hundred pounds\'92 worth of lead or iron , is of as great value as one hundred pounds\'92 worth of silver or gold  . \'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#8"}}{\fldrslt  [ 8 ]}}\
As use values , commodities are , above all , of different qualities , but as exchange values they are merely different quantities , and consequently do not contain an atom of use value  . \
If then we leave out of consideration the use value of commodities , they have only one common property left , that of being products of labour  .  But even the product of labour itself has undergone a change in our hands  .  If we make abstraction from its use value , we make abstraction at the same time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a use value ; we see in it no longer a table , a house , yarn , or any other useful thing  .  Its existence as a material thing is put out of sight  .  Neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the joiner , the mason , the spinner , or of any other definite kind of productive labour  .  Along with the useful qualities of the products themselves , we put out of sight both the useful character of the various kinds of labour embodied in them , and the concrete forms of that labour ; there is nothing left but what is common to them all ; all are reduced to one and the same sort of labour , human labour in the abstract  . \
Let us now consider the residue of each of these products ; it consists of the same unsubstantial reality in each , a mere congelation of homogeneous human labour , of labour power expended without regard to the mode of its expenditure  .  All that these things now tell us is , that human labour power has been expended in their production , that human labour is embodied in them  .  When looked at as crystals of this social substance , common to them all , they are \'96 Values  . \
We have seen that when commodities are exchanged , their exchange value manifests itself as something totally independent of their use value  .  But if we abstract from their use value , there remains their Value as defined above  .  Therefore , the common substance that manifests itself in the exchange value of commodities , whenever they are exchanged , is their value  .  The progress of our investigation will show that exchange value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed  .  For the present , however , we have to consider the nature of value independently of this , its form  . \
A use value , or useful article , therefore , has value only because human labour in the abstract has been embodied or materialised in it  .  How , then , is the magnitude of this value to be measured  ? Plainly , by the quantity of the value-creating substance , the labour , contained in the article  .  The quantity of labour , however , is measured by its duration , and labour time in its turn finds its standard in weeks , days , and hours  . \
Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labour spent on it , the more idle and unskilful the labourer , the more valuable would his commodity be , because more time would be required in its production  .  The labour , however , that forms the substance of value , is homogeneous human labour , expenditure of one uniform labour power  .  The total labour power of society , which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society , counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labour power , composed though it be of innumerable individual units  .  Each of these units is the same as any other , so far as it has the character of the average labour power of society , and takes effect as such ; that is , so far as it requires for producing a commodity , no more time than is needed on an average , no more than is socially necessary  .  The labour time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production , and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time  .  The introduction of power-looms into England probably reduced by one-half the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth  .  The hand-loom weavers , as a matter of fact , continued to require the same time as before ; but for all that , the product of one hour of their labour represented after the change only half an hour\'92s social labour , and consequently fell to one-half its former value  . \
We see then that that which determines the magnitude of the value of any article is the amount of labour socially necessary , or the labour time socially necessary for its production  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#9"}}{\fldrslt  [ 9 ]}}\'a0Each individual commodity , in this connexion , is to be considered as an average sample of its class  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#10"}}{\fldrslt  [ 10 ]}}\'a0Commodities , therefore , in which equal quantities of labour are embodied , or which can be produced in the same time , have the same value  .  The value of one commodity is to the value of any other , as the labour time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other  .  \'93As values , all commodities are only definite masses of congealed labour time  . \'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#11"}}{\fldrslt  [ 11 ]}}\
The value of a commodity would therefore remain constant , if the labour time required for its production also remained constant  .  But the latter changes with every variation in the productiveness of labour  .  This productiveness is determined by various circumstances , amongst others , by the average amount of skill of the workmen , the state of science , and the degree of its practical application , the social organisation of production , the extent and capabilities of the means of production , and by physical conditions  .  For example , the same amount of labour in favourable seasons is embodied in 8 bushels of corn , and in unfavourable , only in four  .  The same labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines  .  Diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earth\'92s surface , and hence their discovery costs , on an average , a great deal of labour time  .  Consequently much labour is represented in a small compass  .  Jacob doubts whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value  .  This applies still more to diamonds  .  According to Eschwege , the total produce of the Brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years , ending in 1823 , had not realised the price of one-and-a-half years\'92 average produce of the sugar and coffee plantations of the same country , although the diamonds cost much more labour , and therefore represented more value  .  With richer mines , the same quantity of labour would embody itself in more diamonds , and their value would fall  .  If we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour , in converting carbon into diamonds , their value might fall below that of bricks  .  In general , the greater the productiveness of labour , the less is the labour time required for the production of an article , the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article , and the less is its value ; and\'a0vice vers\'e2 , the less the productiveness of labour , the greater is the labour time required for the production of an article , and the greater is its value  .  The value of a commodity , therefore , varies directly as the quantity , and inversely as the productiveness , of the labour incorporated in it  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\
A thing can be a use value , without having value  .  This is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour  .  Such are air , virgin soil , natural meadows , &c  .  A thing can be useful , and the product of human labour , without being a commodity  .  Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour , creates , indeed , use values , but not commodities  .  In order to produce the latter , he must not only produce use values , but use values for others , social use values  .  (  And not only for others , without more  .  The mediaeval peasant produced quit-rent-corn for his feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson  .  But neither the quit-rent-corn nor the tithe-corn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others  .  To become a commodity a product must be transferred to another , whom it will serve as a use value , by means of an exchange  .   ){\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#12"}}{\fldrslt  [ 12 ]}}\'a0Lastly nothing can have value , without being an object of utility  .  If the thing is useless , so is the labour contained in it ; the labour does not count as labour , and therefore creates no value  . \

SECTION 2\
THE TWO-FOLD CHARACTER OF\uc0\u8232 THE LABOUR EMBODIED IN COMMODITIES\
\
\'a0\
At first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of two things \'96 use value and exchange value  .  Later on , we saw also that labour , too , possesses the same two-fold nature ; for , so far as it finds expression in value , it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it as a creator of use values  .  I was the first to point out and to examine critically this two-fold nature of the labour contained in commodities  .  As this point is the pivot on which a clear comprehension of political economy turns , we must go more into detail  . \
Let us take two commodities such as a coat and 10 yards of linen , and let the former be double the value of the latter , so that , if 10 yards of linen = W , the coat = 2W  . \
The coat is a use value that satisfies a particular want  .  Its existence is the result of a special sort of productive activity , the nature of which is determined by its aim , mode of operation , subject , means , and result  .  The labour , whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product , or which manifests itself by making its product a use value , we call useful labour  .  In this connection we consider only its useful effect  . \
As the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different use values , so also are the two forms of labour that produce them , tailoring and weaving  .  Were these two objects not qualitatively different , not produced respectively by labour of different quality , they could not stand to each other in the relation of commodities  .  Coats are not exchanged for coats , one use value is not exchanged for another of the same kind  . \
To all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many different kinds of useful labour , classified according to the order , genus , species , and variety to which they belong in the social division of labour  .  This division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of commodities , but it does not follow , conversely , that the production of commodities is a necessary condition for the division of labour  .  In the primitive Indian community there is social division of labour , without production of commodities  .  Or , to take an example nearer home , in every factory the labour is divided according to a system , but this division is not brought about by the operatives mutually exchanging their individual products  .  Only such products can become commodities with regard to each other , as result from different kinds of labour , each kind being carried on independently and for the account of private individuals  . \
To resume , then  : In the use value of each commodity there is contained useful labour ,\'a0i  . e  .  , productive activity of a definite kind and exercised with a definite aim  .  Use values cannot confront each other as commodities , unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in each of them  .  In a community , the produce of which in general takes the form of commodities ,\'a0i  . e  .  , in a community of commodity producers , this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently of individual producers , each on their own account , develops into a complex system , a social division of labour  . \
Anyhow , whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer , in either case it operates as a use value  .  Nor is the relation between the coat and the labour that produced it altered by the circumstance that tailoring may have become a special trade , an independent branch of the social division of labour  .  Wherever the want of clothing forced them to it , the human race made clothes for thousands of years , without a single man becoming a tailor  .  But coats and linen , like every other element of material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of Nature , must invariably owe their existence to a special productive activity , exercised with a definite aim , an activity that appropriates particular nature-given materials to particular human wants  .  So far therefore as labour is a creator of use value , is useful labour , it is a necessary condition , independent of all forms of society , for the existence of the human race ; it is an eternal nature-imposed necessity , without which there can be no material exchanges between man and Nature , and therefore no life  . \
The use values , coat , linen , &c  .  ,\'a0i  . e  .  , the bodies of commodities , are combinations of two elements \'96 matter and labour  .  If we take away the useful labour expended upon them , a material substratum is always left , which is furnished by Nature without the help of man  .  The latter can work only as Nature does , that is by changing the form of matter  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#13"}}{\fldrslt  [ 13 ]}}\'a0Nay more , in this work of changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces  .  We see , then , that labour is not the only source of material wealth , of use values produced by labour  .  As William Petty puts it , labour is its father and the earth its mother  . \
Let us now pass from the commodity considered as a use value to the value of commodities  . \
By our assumption , the coat is worth twice as much as the linen  .  But this is a mere quantitative difference , which for the present does not concern us  .  We bear in mind , however , that if the value of the coat is double that of 10 yds of linen , 20 yds of linen must have the same value as one coat  .  So far as they are values , the coat and the linen are things of a like substance , objective expressions of essentially identical labour  .  But tailoring and weaving are , qualitatively , different kinds of labour  .  There are , however , states of society in which one and the same man does tailoring and weaving alternately , in which case these two forms of labour are mere modifications of the labour of the same individual , and not special and fixed functions of different persons , just as the coat which our tailor makes one day , and the trousers which he makes another day , imply only a variation in the labour of one and the same individual  .  Moreover , we see at a glance that , in our capitalist society , a given portion of human labour is , in accordance with the varying demand , at one time supplied in the form of tailoring , at another in the form of weaving  .  This change may possibly not take place without friction , but take place it must  . \
Productive activity , if we leave out of sight its special form , viz  .  , the useful character of the labour , is nothing but the expenditure of human labour power  .  Tailoring and weaving , though qualitatively different productive activities , are each a productive expenditure of human brains , nerves , and muscles , and in this sense are human labour  .  They are but two different modes of expending human labour power  .  Of course , this labour power , which remains the same under all its modifications , must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in a multiplicity of modes  .  But the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract , the expenditure of human labour in general  .  And just as in society , a general or a banker plays a great part , but mere man , on the other hand , a very shabby part ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#14"}}{\fldrslt  [ 14 ]}}\'a0so here with mere human labour  .  It is the expenditure of simple labour power ,\'a0i  . e  .  , of the labour power which , on an average , apart from any special development , exists in the organism of every ordinary individual  .  Simple average labour , it is true , varies in character in different countries and at different times , but in a particular society it is given  .  Skilled labour counts only as simple labour intensified , or rather , as multiplied simple labour , a given quantity of skilled being considered equal to a greater quantity of simple labour  .  Experience shows that this reduction is constantly being made  .  A commodity may be the product of the most skilled labour , but its value , by equating it to the product of simple unskilled labour , represents a definite quantity of the latter labour alone  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#15"}}{\fldrslt  [ 15 ]}}\'a0The different proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their standard , are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers , and , consequently , appear to be fixed by custom  .  For simplicity\'92s sake we shall henceforth account every kind of labour to be unskilled , simple labour ; by this we do no more than save ourselves the trouble of making the reduction  . \
Just as , therefore , in viewing the coat and linen as values , we abstract from their different use values , so it is with the labour represented by those values  : we disregard the difference between its useful forms , weaving and tailoring  .  As the use values , coat and linen , are combinations of special productive activities with cloth and yarn , while the values , coat and linen , are , on the other hand , mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour , so the labour embodied in these latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn , but only as being expenditure of human labour power  .  Tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation of the use values , coat and linen , precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different qualities ; but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities , only in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour , do tailoring and weaving form the substance of the values of the same articles  . \
Coats and linen , however , are not merely values , but values of definite magnitude , and according to our assumption , the coat is worth twice as much as the ten yards of linen  .  Whence this difference in their values  ? It is owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much labour as the coat , and consequently , that in the production of the latter , labour power must have been expended during twice the time necessary for the production of the former  . \
While , therefore , with reference to use value , the labour contained in a commodity counts only qualitatively , with reference to value it counts only quantitatively , and must first be reduced to human labour pure and simple  .  In the former case , it is a question of How and What , in the latter of How much  ? How long a time  ? Since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents only the quantity of labour embodied in it , it follows that all commodities , when taken in certain proportions , must be equal in value  . \
If the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour required for the production of a coat remains unchanged , the sum of the values of the coats produced increases with their number  .  If one coat represents x days\'92 labour , two coats represent 2x days\'92 labour , and so on  .  But assume that the duration of the labour necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled or halved  .  In the first case one coat is worth as much as two coats were before ; in the second case , two coats are only worth as much as one was before , although in both cases one coat renders the same service as before , and the useful labour embodied in it remains of the same quality  .  But the quantity of labour spent on its production has altered  . \
An increase in the quantity of use values is an increase of material wealth  .  With two coats two men can be clothed , with one coat only one man  .  Nevertheless , an increased quantity of material wealth may correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value  .  This antagonistic movement has its origin in the two-fold character of labour  .  Productive power has reference , of course , only to labour of some useful concrete form , the efficacy of any special productive activity during a given time being dependent on its productiveness  .  Useful labour becomes , therefore , a more or less abundant source of products , in proportion to the rise or fall of its productiveness  .  On the other hand , no change in this productiveness affects the labour represented by value  .  Since productive power is an attribute of the concrete useful forms of labour , of course it can no longer have any bearing on that labour , so soon as we make abstraction from those concrete useful forms  .  However then productive power may vary , the same labour , exercised during equal periods of time , always yields equal amounts of value  .  But it will yield , during equal periods of time , different quantities of values in use ; more , if the productive power rise , fewer , if it fall  .  The same change in productive power , which increases the fruitfulness of labour , and , in consequence , the quantity of use values produced by that labour , will diminish the total value of this increased quantity of use values , provided such change shorten the total labour time necessary for their production ; and\'a0vice vers\'e2  . \
On the one hand all labour is , speaking physiologically , an expenditure of human labour power , and in its character of identical abstract human labour , it creates and forms the value of commodities  .  On the other hand , all labour is the expenditure of human labour power in a special form and with a definite aim , and in this , its character of concrete useful labour , it produces use values  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#16"}}{\fldrslt  [ 16 ]}}\

SECTION 3\
THE FORM OF VALUE OR EXCHANGE VALUE\
\
\'a0\
Commodities come into the world in the shape of use values , articles , or goods , such as iron , linen , corn , &c  .  This is their plain , homely , bodily form  .  They are , however , commodities , only because they are something two-fold , both objects of utility , and , at the same time , depositories of value  .  They manifest themselves therefore as commodities , or have the form of commodities , only in so far as they have two forms , a physical or natural form , and a value form  . \
The reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from Dame Quickly , that we don\'92t know \'93where to have it  . \'94 The value of commodities is the very opposite of the coarse materiality of their substance , not an atom of matter enters into its composition  .  Turn and examine a single commodity , by itself , as we will , yet in so far as it remains an object of value , it seems impossible to grasp it  .  If , however , we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a purely social reality , and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they are expressions or embodiments of one identical social substance , viz  .  , human labour , it follows as a matter of course , that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to commodity  .  In fact we started from exchange value , or the exchange relation of commodities , in order to get at the value that lies hidden behind it  .  We must now return to this form under which value first appeared to us  . \
Every one knows , if he knows nothing else , that commodities have a value form common to them all , and presenting a marked contrast with the varied bodily forms of their use values  .  I mean their money form  .  Here , however , a task is set us , the performance of which has never yet even been attempted by\'a0bourgeois\'a0economy , the task of tracing the genesis of this money form , of developing the expression of value implied in the value relation of commodities , from its simplest , almost imperceptible outline , to the dazzling money-form  .  By doing this we shall , at the same time , solve the riddle presented by money  . \
The simplest value-relation is evidently that of one commodity to some one other commodity of a different kind  .  Hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of a single commodity  . \'a0\uc0\u8232 \
A  .  Elementary or Accidental Form Of Value\
x commodity A = y commodity B , or\'a0\uc0\u8232 x commodity A is worth y commodity B  . \
20 yards of linen = 1 coat , or\'a0\uc0\u8232 20 Yards of linen are worth 1 coat  . \
\
1  .  The two poles of the expression of value  .  Relative form and Equivalent form\
The whole mystery of the form of value lies hidden in this elementary form  .  Its analysis , therefore , is our real difficulty  . \
Here two different kinds of commodities (  in our example the linen and the coat  ) , evidently play two different parts  .  The linen expresses its value in the coat ; the coat serves as the material in which that value is expressed  .  The former plays an active , the latter a passive , part  .  The value of the linen is represented as relative value , or appears in relative form  .  The coat officiates as equivalent , or appears in equivalent form  . \
The relative form and the equivalent form are two intimately connected , mutually dependent and inseparable elements of the expression of value ; but , at the same time , are mutually exclusive , antagonistic extremes \'96\'a0i  . e  .  , poles of the same expression  .  They are allotted respectively to the two different commodities brought into relation by that expression  .  It is not possible to express the value of linen in linen  .  20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen is no expression of value  .  On the contrary , such an equation merely says that 20 yards of linen are nothing else than 20 yards of linen , a definite quantity of the use value linen  .  The value of the linen can therefore be expressed only relatively \'96\'a0i  . e  .  , in some other commodity  .  The relative form of the value of the linen presupposes , therefore , the presence of some other commodity \'96 here the coat \'96 under the form of an equivalent  .  On the other hand , the commodity that figures as the equivalent cannot at the same time assume the relative form  .  That second commodity is not the one whose value is expressed  .  Its function is merely to serve as the material in which the value of the first commodity is expressed  . \
No doubt , the expression 20 yards of linen = 1 coat , or 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat , implies the opposite relation  .  1 coat = 20 yards of linen , or 1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen  .  But , in that case , I must reverse the equation , in order to express the value of the coat relatively ; and so soon as I do that the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the coat  .  A single commodity cannot , therefore , simultaneously assume , in the same expression of value , both forms  .  The very polarity of these forms makes them mutually exclusive  . \
Whether , then , a commodity assumes the relative form , or the opposite equivalent form , depends entirely upon its accidental position in the expression of value \'96 that is , upon whether it is the commodity whose value is being expressed or the commodity in which value is being expressed  . \
2  .  The Relative Form of value\
(  a  .   ) The nature and import of this form\
\
In order to discover how the elementary expression of the value of a commodity lies hidden in the value relation of two commodities , we must , in the first place , consider the latter entirely apart from its quantitative aspect  .  The usual mode of procedure is generally the reverse , and in the value relation nothing is seen but the proportion between definite quantities of two different sorts of commodities that are considered equal to each other  .  It is apt to be forgotten that the magnitudes of different things can be compared quantitatively , only when those magnitudes are expressed in terms of the same unit  .  It is only as expressions of such a unit that they are of the same denomination , and therefore commensurable  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#17"}}{\fldrslt  [ 17 ]}}\
Whether 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 20 coats or = x coats \'96 that is , whether a given quantity of linen is worth few or many coats , every such statement implies that the linen and coats , as magnitudes of value , are expressions of the same unit , things of the same kind  .  Linen = coat is the basis of the equation  . \
But the two commodities whose identity of quality is thus assumed , do not play the same part  .  It is only the value of the linen that is expressed  .  And how  ? By its reference to the coat as its equivalent , as something that can be exchanged for it  .  In this relation the coat is the mode of existence of value , is value embodied , for only as such is it the same as the linen  .  On the other hand , the linen\'92s own value comes to the front , receives independent expression , for it is only as being value that it is comparable with the coat as a thing of equal value , or exchangeable with the coat  .  To borrow an illustration from chemistry , butyric acid is a different substance from propyl formate  .  Yet both are made up of the same chemical substances , carbon (  C  ) , hydrogen (  H  ) , and oxygen (  O  ) , and that , too , in like proportions \'96 namely , C4H8O2  .  If now we equate butyric acid to propyl formate , then , in the first place , propyl formate would be , in this relation , merely a form of existence of C4H8O2 ; and in the second place , we should be stating that butyric acid also consists of C4H8O2  .  Therefore , by thus equating the two substances , expression would be given to their chemical composition , while their different physical forms would be neglected  . \
If we say that , as values , commodities are mere congelations of human labour , we reduce them by our analysis , it is true , to the abstraction , value ; but we ascribe to this value no form apart from their bodily form  .  It is otherwise in the value relation of one commodity to another  .  Here , the one stands forth in its character of value by reason of its relation to the other  . \
By making the coat the equivalent of the linen , we equate the labour embodied in the former to that in the latter  .  Now , it is true that the tailoring , which makes the coat , is concrete labour of a different sort from the weaving which makes the linen  .  But the act of equating it to the weaving , reduces the tailoring to that which is really equal in the two kinds of labour , to their common character of human labour  .  In this roundabout way , then , the fact is expressed , that weaving also , in so far as it weaves value , has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring , and , consequently , is abstract human labour  .  It is the expression of equivalence between different sorts of commodities that alone brings into relief the specific character of value-creating labour , and this it does by actually reducing the different varieties of labour embodied in the different kinds of commodities to their common quality of human labour in the abstract  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#18"}}{\fldrslt  [ 18 ]}}\
There is , however , something else required beyond the expression of the specific character of the labour of which the value of the linen consists  .  Human labour power in motion , or human labour , creates value , but is not itself value  .  It becomes value only in its congealed state , when embodied in the form of some object  .  In order to express the value of the linen as a congelation of human labour , that value must be expressed as having objective existence , as being a something materially different from the linen itself , and yet a something common to the linen and all other commodities  .  The problem is already solved  . \
When occupying the position of equivalent in the equation of value , the coat ranks qualitatively as the equal of the linen , as something of the same kind , because it is value  .  In this position it is a thing in which we see nothing but value , or whose palpable bodily form represents value  .  Yet the coat itself , the body of the commodity , coat , is a mere use value  .  A coat as such no more tells us it is value , than does the first piece of linen we take hold of  .  This shows that when placed in value-relation to the linen , the coat signifies more than when out of that relation , just as many a man strutting about in a gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in mufti  . \
In the production of the coat , human labour power , in the shape of tailoring , must have been actually expended  .  Human labour is therefore accumulated in it  .  In this aspect the coat is a depository of value , but though worn to a thread , it does not let this fact show through  .  And as equivalent of the linen in the value equation , it exists under this aspect alone , counts therefore as embodied value , as a body that is value  .  A , for instance , cannot be \'93your majesty\'94 to B , unless at the same time majesty in B\'92s eyes assumes the bodily form of A , and , what is more , with every new father of the people , changes its features , hair , and many other things besides  . \
Hence , in the value equation , in which the coat is the equivalent of the linen , the coat officiates as the form of value  .  The value of the commodity linen is expressed by the bodily form of the commodity coat , the value of one by the use value of the other  .  As a use value , the linen is something palpably different from the coat ; as value , it is the same as the coat , and now has the appearance of a coat  .  Thus the linen acquires a value form different from its physical form  .  The fact that it is value , is made manifest by its equality with the coat , just as the sheep\'92s nature of a Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God  . \
We see , then , all that our analysis of the value of commodities has already told us , is told us by the linen itself , so soon as it comes into communication with another commodity , the coat  .  Only it betrays its thoughts in that language with which alone it is familiar , the language of commodities  .  In order to tell us that its own value is created by labour in its abstract character of human labour , it says that the coat , in so far as it is worth as much as the linen , and therefore is value , consists of the same labour as the linen  .  In order to inform us that its sublime reality as value is not the same as its buckram body , it says that value has the appearance of a coat , and consequently that so far as the linen is value , it and the coat are as like as two peas  .  We may here remark , that the language of commodities has , besides Hebrew , many other more or less correct dialects  .  The German \'93Wertsein ,\'94 to be worth , for instance , expresses in a less striking manner than the Romance verbs \'93valere ,\'94 \'93valer ,\'94 \'93valoir ,\'94 that the equating of commodity B to commodity A , is commodity A\'92s own mode of expressing its value  . \'a0Paris vaut bien une messe  . \'a0 [ Paris is certainly worth a mass ]\
By means , therefore , of the value-relation expressed in our equation , the bodily form of commodity B becomes the value form of commodity A , or the body of commodity B acts as a mirror to the value of commodity A  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#19"}}{\fldrslt  [ 19 ]}}\'a0By putting itself in relation with commodity B , as value\'a0in propri\'e2 person\'e2 , as the matter of which human labour is made up , the commodity A converts the value in use , B , into the substance in which to express its , A\'92s , own value  .  The value of A , thus expressed in the use value of B , has taken the form of relative value  . \
(  b  .   ) Quantitative determination of Relative value\
\
Every commodity , whose value it is intended to express , is a useful object of given quantity , as 15 bushels of corn , or 100 lbs of coffee  .  And a given quantity of any commodity contains a definite quantity of human labour  .  The value form must therefore not only express value generally , but also value in definite quantity  .  Therefore , in the value relation of commodity A to commodity B , of the linen to the coat , not only is the latter , as value in general , made the equal in quality of the linen , but a definite quantity of coat (  1 coat  ) is made the equivalent of a definite quantity (  20 yards  ) of linen  . \
The equation , 20 yards of linen = 1 coat , or 20 yards of linen are worth one coat , implies that the same quantity of value substance (  congealed labour  ) is embodied in both ; that the two commodities have each cost the same amount of labour of the same quantity of labour time  .  But the labour time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every change in the productiveness of weaving or tailoring  .  We have now to consider the influence of such changes on the quantitative aspect of the relative expression of value  . \
I  .  Let the value of the linen vary ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#20"}}{\fldrslt  [ 20 ]}}\'a0that of the coat remaining constant  .  If , say in consequence of the exhaustion of flax-growing soil , the labour time necessary for the production of the linen be doubled , the value of the linen will also be doubled  .  Instead of the equation , 20 yards of linen = 1 coat , we should have 20 yards of linen = 2 coats , since 1 coat would now contain only half the labour time embodied in 20 yards of linen  .  If , on the other hand , in consequence , say , of improved looms , this labour time be reduced by one-half , the value of the linen would fall by one-half  .  Consequently , we should have 20 yards of linen = \'bd coat  .  The relative value of commodity A ,\'a0i  . e  .  , its value expressed in commodity B , rises and falls directly as the value of A , the value of B being supposed constant  . \
II  .  Let the value of the linen remain constant , while the value of the coat varies  .  If , under these circumstances , in consequence , for instance , of a poor crop of wool , the labour time necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled , we have instead of 20 yards of linen = 1 coat , 20 yards of linen = \'bd coat  .  If , on the other hand , the value of the coat sinks by one-half , then 20 yards of linen = 2 coats  .  Hence , if the value of commodity A remain constant , its relative value expressed in commodity B rises and falls inversely as the value of B  . \
If we compare the different cases in I and II , we see that the same change of magnitude in relative value may arise from totally opposite causes  .  Thus , the equation , 20 yards of linen = 1 coat , becomes 20 yards of linen = 2 coats , either , because the value of the linen has doubled , or because the value of the coat has fallen by one-half ; and it becomes 20 yards of linen = \'bd coat , either , because the value of the linen has fallen by one-half , or because the value of the coat has doubled  . \
III  .  Let the quantities of labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat vary simultaneously in the same direction and in the same proportion  .  In this case 20 yards of linen continue equal to 1 coat , however much their values may have altered  .  Their change of value is seen as soon as they are compared with a third commodity , whose value has remained constant  .  If the values of all commodities rose or fell simultaneously , and in the same proportion , their relative values would remain unaltered  .  Their real change of value would appear from the diminished or increased quantity of commodities produced in a given time  . \
IV  .  The labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat , and therefore the value of these commodities may simultaneously vary in the same direction , but at unequal rates or in opposite directions , or in other ways  .  The effect of all these possible different variations , on the relative value of a commodity , may be deduced from the results of I , II , and III  . \
Thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally nor exhaustively reflected in their relative expression , that is , in the equation expressing the magnitude of relative value  .  The relative value of a commodity may vary , although its value remains constant  .  Its relative value may remain constant , although its value varies ; and finally , simultaneous variations in the magnitude of value and in that of its relative expression by no means necessarily correspond in amount  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#21"}}{\fldrslt  [ 21 ]}}\
3  .  The Equivalent form of value\
We have seen that commodity A (  the linen  ) , by expressing its value in the use value of a commodity differing in kind (  the coat  ) , at the same time impresses upon the latter a specific form of value , namely that of the equivalent  .  The commodity linen manifests its quality of having a value by the fact that the coat , without having assumed a value form different from its bodily form , is equated to the linen  .  The fact that the latter therefore has a value is expressed by saying that the coat is directly exchangeable with it  .  Therefore , when we say that a commodity is in the equivalent form , we express the fact that it is directly exchangeable with other commodities  . \
When one commodity , such as a coat , serves as the equivalent of another , such as linen , and coats consequently acquire the characteristic property of being directly exchangeable with linen , we are far from knowing in what proportion the two are exchangeable  .  The value of the linen being given in magnitude , that proportion depends on the value of the coat  .  Whether the coat serves as the equivalent and the linen as relative value , or the linen as the equivalent and the coat as relative value , the magnitude of the coat\'92s value is determined , independently of its value form , by the labour time necessary for its production  .  But whenever the coat assumes in the equation of value , the position of equivalent , its value acquires no quantitative expression ; on the contrary , the commodity coat now figures only as a definite quantity of some article  . \
For instance , 40 yards of linen are worth \'96 what  ? 2 coats  .  Because the commodity coat here plays the part of equivalent , because the use-value coat , as opposed to the linen , figures as an embodiment of value , therefore a definite number of coats suffices to express the definite quantity of value in the linen  .  Two coats may therefore express the quantity of value of 40 yards of linen , but they can never express the quantity of their own value  .  A superficial observation of this fact , namely , that in the equation of value , the equivalent figures exclusively as a simple quantity of some article , of some use value , has misled Bailey , as also many others , both before and after him , into seeing , in the expression of value , merely a quantitative relation  .  The truth being , that when a commodity acts as equivalent , no quantitative determination of its value is expressed  . \
The first peculiarity that strikes us , in considering the form of the equivalent , is this  : use value becomes the form of manifestation , the phenomenal form of its opposite , value  . \
The bodily form of the commodity becomes its value form  .  But , mark well , that this\'a0quid pro quo\'a0exists in the case of any commodity B , only when some other commodity A enters into a value relation with it , and then only within the limits of this relation  .  Since no commodity can stand in the relation of equivalent to itself , and thus turn its own bodily shape into the expression of its own value , every commodity is compelled to choose some other commodity for its equivalent , and to accept the use value , that is to say , the bodily shape of that other commodity as the form of its own value  . \
One of the measures that we apply to commodities as material substances , as use values , will serve to illustrate this point  .  A sugar-loaf being a body , is heavy , and therefore has weight  : but we can neither see nor touch this weight  .  We then take various pieces of iron , whose weight has been determined beforehand  .  The iron , as iron , is no more the form of manifestation of weight , than is the sugar-loaf  .  Nevertheless , in order to express the sugar-loaf as so much weight , we put it into a weight-relation with the iron  .  In this relation , the iron officiates as a body representing nothing but weight  .  A certain quantity of iron therefore serves as the measure of the weight of the sugar , and represents , in relation to the sugar-loaf , weight embodied , the form of manifestation of weight  .  This part is played by the iron only within this relation , into which the sugar or any other body , whose weight has to be determined , enters with the iron  .  Were they not both heavy , they could not enter into this relation , and the one could therefore not serve as the expression of the weight of the other  .  When we throw both into the scales , we see in reality , that as weight they are both the same , and that , therefore , when taken in proper proportions , they have the same weight  .  Just as the substance iron , as a measure of weight , represents in relation to the sugar-loaf weight alone , so , in our expression of value , the material object , coat , in relation to the linen , represents value alone  . \
Here , however , the analogy ceases  .  The iron , in the expression of the weight of the sugar-loaf , represents a natural property common to both bodies , namely their weight ; but the coat , in the expression of value of the linen , represents a non-natural property of both , something purely social , namely , their value  . \
Since the relative form of value of a commodity \'96 the linen , for example \'96 expresses the value of that commodity , as being something wholly different from its substance and properties , as being , for instance , coat-like , we see that this expression itself indicates that some social relation lies at the bottom of it  .  With the equivalent form it is just the contrary  .  The very essence of this form is that the material commodity itself \'96 the coat \'96 just as it is , expresses value , and is endowed with the form of value by Nature itself  .  Of course this holds good only so long as the value relation exists , in which the coat stands in the position of equivalent to the linen  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#22"}}{\fldrslt  [ 22 ]}}\'a0Since , however , the properties of a thing are not the result of its relations to other things , but only manifest themselves in such relations , the coat seems to be endowed with its equivalent form , its property of being directly exchangeable , just as much by Nature as it is endowed with the property of being heavy , or the capacity to keep us warm  .  Hence the enigmatical character of the equivalent form which escapes the notice of the bourgeois political economist , until this form , completely developed , confronts him in the shape of money  .  He then seeks to explain away the mystical character of gold and silver , by substituting for them less dazzling commodities , and by reciting , with ever renewed satisfaction , the catalogue of all possible commodities which at one time or another have played the part of equivalent  .  He has not the least suspicion that the most simple expression of value , such as 20 yds of linen = 1 coat , already propounds the riddle of the equivalent form for our solution  . \
The body of the commodity that serves as the equivalent , figures as the materialisation of human labour in the abstract , and is at the same time the product of some specifically useful concrete labour  .  This concrete labour becomes , therefore , the medium for expressing abstract human labour  .  If on the one hand the coat ranks as nothing but the embodiment of abstract human labour , so , on the other hand , the tailoring which is actually embodied in it , counts as nothing but the form under which that abstract labour is realised  .  In the expression of value of the linen , the utility of the tailoring consists , not in making clothes , but in making an object , which we at once recognise to be Value , and therefore to be a congelation of labour , but of labour indistinguishable from that realised in the value of the linen  .  In order to act as such a mirror of value , the labour of tailoring must reflect nothing besides its own abstract quality of being human labour generally  . \
In tailoring , as well as in weaving , human labour power is expended  .  Both , therefore , possess the general property of being human labour , and may , therefore , in certain cases , such as in the production of value , have to be considered under this aspect alone  .  There is nothing mysterious in this  .  But in the expression of value there is a complete turn of the tables  .  For instance , how is the fact to be expressed that weaving creates the value of the linen , not by virtue of being weaving , as such , but by reason of its general property of being human labour  ? Simply by opposing to weaving that other particular form of concrete labour (  in this instance tailoring  ) , which produces the equivalent of the product of weaving  .  Just as the coat in its bodily form became a direct expression of value , so now does tailoring , a concrete form of labour , appear as the direct and palpable embodiment of human labour generally  . \
Hence , the second peculiarity of the equivalent form is , that concrete labour becomes the form under which its opposite , abstract human labour , manifests itself  . \
But because this concrete labour , tailoring in our case , ranks as , and is directly identified with , undifferentiated human labour , it also ranks as identical with any other sort of labour , and therefore with that embodied in the linen  .  Consequently , although , like all other commodity-producing labour , it is the labour of private individuals , yet , at the same time , it ranks as labour directly social in its character  .  This is the reason why it results in a product directly exchangeable with other commodities  .  We have then a third peculiarity of the equivalent form , namely , that the labour of private individuals takes the form of its opposite , labour directly social in its form  . \
The two latter peculiarities of the equivalent form will become more intelligible if we go back to the great thinker who was the first to analyse so many forms , whether of thought , society , or Nature , and amongst them also the form of value  .  I mean Aristotle  . \
In the first place , he clearly enunciates that the money form of commodities is only the further development of the simple form of value \'96\'a0i  . e  .  , of the expression of the value of one commodity in some other commodity taken at random ; for he says  :\
5 beds = 1 house (  clinai pente anti oicia\uc0\u962   )\
is not to be distinguished from\
5 beds = so much money  .  (  clinai pente anti   .   .   .  oson ai pente clinai  )\
He further sees that the value relation which gives rise to this expression makes it necessary that the house should qualitatively be made the equal of the bed , and that , without such an equalisation , these two clearly different things could not be compared with each other as commensurable quantities  .  \'93Exchange ,\'94 he says , \'93cannot take place without equality , and equality not without commensurability  "    .  (  out isoth\uc0\u962 \'a0mh oush\u962 \'a0snmmetria\u962   )  .  Here , however , he comes to a stop , and gives up the further analysis of the form of value  .  \'93It is , however , in reality , impossible (  th men oun alhqeia adunaton  ) , that such unlike things can be commensurable\'94 \'96\'a0i  . e  .  , qualitatively equal  .  Such an equalisation can only be something foreign to their real nature , consequently only \'93a makeshift for practical purposes  . \'94\
Aristotle therefore , himself , tells us what barred the way to his further analysis ; it was the absence of any concept of value  .  What is that equal something , that common substance , which admits of the value of the beds being expressed by a house  ? Such a thing , in truth , cannot exist , says Aristotle  .  And why not  ? Compared with the beds , the house does represent something equal to them , in so far as it represents what is really equal , both in the beds and the house  .  And that is \'96 human labour  . \
There was , however , an important fact which prevented Aristotle from seeing that , to attribute value to commodities , is merely a mode of expressing all labour as equal human labour , and consequently as labour of equal quality  .  Greek society was founded upon slavery , and had , therefore , for its natural basis , the inequality of men and of their labour powers  .  The secret of the expression of value , namely , that all kinds of labour are equal and equivalent , because , and so far as they are human labour in general , cannot be deciphered , until the notion of human equality has already acquired the fixity of a popular prejudice  .  This , however , is possible only in a society in which the great mass of the produce of labour takes the form of commodities , in which , consequently , the dominant relation between man and man , is that of owners of commodities  .  The brilliancy of Aristotle\'92s genius is shown by this alone , that he discovered , in the expression of the value of commodities , a relation of equality  .  The peculiar conditions of the society in which he lived , alone prevented him from discovering what , \'93in truth ,\'94 was at the bottom of this equality  . \
4  .  The Elementary Form of value considered as a whole\
The elementary form of value of a commodity is contained in the equation , expressing its value relation to another commodity of a different kind , or in its exchange relation to the same  .  The value of commodity A , is qualitatively expressed , by the fact that commodity B is directly exchangeable with it  .  Its value is quantitatively expressed by the fact , that a definite quantity of B is exchangeable with a definite quantity of A  .  In other words , the value of a commodity obtains independent and definite expression , by taking the form of exchange value  .  When , at the beginning of this chapter , we said , in common parlance , that a commodity is both a use value and an exchange value , we were , accurately speaking , wrong  .  A commodity is a use value or object of utility , and a value  .  It manifests itself as this two-fold thing , that it is , as soon as its value assumes an independent form \'96 viz  .  , the form of exchange value  .  It never assumes this form when isolated , but only when placed in a value or exchange relation with another commodity of a different kind  .  When once we know this , such a mode of expression does no harm ; it simply serves as an abbreviation  . \
Our analysis has shown , that the form or expression of the value of a commodity originates in the nature of value , and not that value and its magnitude originate in the mode of their expression as exchange value  .  This , however , is the delusion as well of the mercantilists and their recent revivers , Ferrier , Ganilh ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#23"}}{\fldrslt  [ 23 ]}}\'a0and others , as also of their antipodes , the modern bagmen of Free-trade , such as Bastiat  .  The mercantilists lay special stress on the qualitative aspect of the expression of value , and consequently on the equivalent form of commodities , which attains its full perfection in money  .  The modern hawkers of Free-trade , who must get rid of their article at any price , on the other hand , lay most stress on the quantitative aspect of the relative form of value  .  For them there consequently exists neither value , nor magnitude of value , anywhere except in its expression by means of the exchange relation of commodities , that is , in the daily list of prices current  .  Macleod , who has taken upon himself to dress up the confused ideas of Lombard Street in the most learned finery , is a successful cross between the superstitious mercantilists , and the enlightened Free-trade bagmen  . \
A close scrutiny of the expression of the value of A in terms of B , contained in the equation expressing the value relation of A to B , has shown us that , within that relation , the bodily form of A figures only as a use value , the bodily form of B only as the form or aspect of value  .  The opposition or contrast existing internally in each commodity between use value and value , is , therefore , made evident externally by two commodities being placed in such relation to each other , that the commodity whose value it is sought to express , figures directly as a mere use value , while the commodity in which that value is to be expressed , figures directly as mere exchange value  .  Hence the elementary form of value of a commodity is the elementary form in which the contrast contained in that commodity , between use value and value , becomes apparent  . \
Every product of labour is , in all states of society , a use value ; but it is only at a definite historical epoch in a society\'92s development that such a product becomes a commodity , viz  .  , at the epoch when the labour spent on the production of a useful article becomes expressed as one of the objective qualities of that article ,\'a0i  . e  .  , as its value  .  It therefore follows that the elementary value form is also the primitive form under which a product of labour appears historically as a commodity , and that the gradual transformation of such products into commodities , proceeds\'a0pari passu\'a0with the development of the value form  . \
We perceive , at first sight , the deficiencies of the elementary form of value  : it is a mere germ , which must undergo a series of metamorphoses before it can ripen into the price form  . \
The expression of the value of commodity A in terms of any other commodity B , merely distinguishes the value from the use value of A , and therefore places A merely in a relation of exchange with a single different commodity , B ; but it is still far from expressing A\'92s qualitative equality , and quantitative proportionality , to all commodities  .  To the elementary relative value form of a commodity , there corresponds the single equivalent form of one other commodity  .  Thus , in the relative expression of value of the linen , the coat assumes the form of equivalent , or of being directly exchangeable , only in relation to a single commodity , the linen  . \
Nevertheless , the elementary form of value passes by an easy transition into a more complete form  .  It is true that by means of the elementary form , the value of a commodity A , becomes expressed in terms of one , and only one , other commodity  .  But that one may be a commodity of any kind , coat , iron , corn , or anything else  .  Therefore , according as A is placed in relation with one or the other , we get for one and the same commodity , different elementary expressions of value  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#24"}}{\fldrslt  [ 24 ]}}\'a0The number of such possible expressions is limited only by the number of the different kinds of commodities distinct from it  .  The isolated expression of A\'92s value , is therefore convertible into a series , prolonged to any length , of the different elementary expressions of that value  . \'a0\uc0\u8232 \u8232 \

\
1  .  The Expanded Relative form of value\
The value of a single commodity , the linen , for example , is now expressed in terms of numberless other elements of the world of commodities  .  Every other commodity now becomes a mirror of the linen\'92s value  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#25"}}{\fldrslt  [ 25 ]}}\'a0It is thus , that for the first time , this value shows itself in its true light as a congelation of undifferentiated human labour  .  For the labour that creates it , now stands expressly revealed , as labour that ranks equally with every other sort of human labour , no matter what its form , whether tailoring , ploughing , mining , &c  .  , and no matter , therefore , whether it is realised in coats , corn , iron , or gold  .  The linen , by virtue of the form of its value , now stands in a social relation , no longer with only one other kind of commodity , but with the whole world of commodities  .  As a commodity , it is a citizen of that world  .  At the same time , the interminable series of value equations implies , that as regards the value of a commodity , it is a matter of indifference under what particular form , or kind , of use value it appears  . \
In the first form , 20 yds of linen = 1 coat , it might , for ought that otherwise appears , be pure accident , that these two commodities are exchangeable in definite quantities  .  In the second form , on the contrary , we perceive at once the background that determines , and is essentially different from , this accidental appearance  .  The value of the linen remains unaltered in magnitude , whether expressed in coats , coffee , or iron , or in numberless different commodities , the property of as many different owners  .  The accidental relation between two individual commodity-owners disappears  .  It becomes plain , that it is not the exchange of commodities which regulates the magnitude of their value ; but , on the contrary , that it is the magnitude of their value which controls their exchange proportions  . \
\
2  .  The particular Equivalent form\
Each commodity , such as , coat , tea , corn , iron , &c  .  , figures in the expression of value of the linen , as an equivalent , and , consequently , as a thing that is value  .  The bodily form of each of these commodities figures now as a particular equivalent form , one out of many  .  In the same way the manifold concrete useful kinds of labour , embodied in these different commodities , rank now as so many different forms of the realisation , or manifestation , of undifferentiated human labour  . \
\
3  .  Defects of the Total or Expanded form of value\
In the first place , the relative expression of value is incomplete because the series representing it is interminable  .  The chain of which each equation of value is a link , is liable at any moment to be lengthened by each new kind of commodity that comes into existence and furnishes the material for a fresh expression of value  .  In the second place , it is a many-coloured mosaic of disparate and independent expressions of value  .  And lastly , if , as must be the case , the relative value of each commodity in turn , becomes expressed in this expanded form , we get for each of them a relative value form , different in every case , and consisting of an interminable series of expressions of value  .  The defects of the expanded relative value form are reflected in the corresponding equivalent form  .  Since the bodily form of each single commodity is one particular equivalent form amongst numberless others , we have , on the whole , nothing but fragmentary equivalent forms , each excluding the others  .  In the same way , also , the special , concrete , useful kind of labour embodied in each particular equivalent , is presented only as a particular kind of labour , and therefore not as an exhaustive representative of human labour generally  .  The latter , indeed , gains adequate manifestation in the totality of its manifold , particular , concrete forms  .  But , in that case , its expression in an infinite series is ever incomplete and deficient in unity  . \
The expanded relative value form is , however , nothing but the sum of the elementary relative expressions or equations of the first kind , such as  :\
20 yards of linen = 1 coat\uc0\u8232 20 yards of linen = 10 lbs of tea , etc  . \
Each of these implies the corresponding inverted equation ,\
1 coat = 20 yards of linen\'a0\uc0\u8232 10 lbs of tea = 20 yards of linen , etc  . \
In fact , when a person exchanges his linen for many other commodities , and thus expresses its value in a series of other commodities , it necessarily follows , that the various owners of the latter exchange them for the linen , and consequently express the value of their various commodities in one and the same third commodity , the linen  .  If then , we reverse the series , 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lbs of tea , etc  .  , that is to say , if we give expression to the converse relation already implied in the series , we get ,\

1  .  The altered character of the form of value\
All commodities now express their value (  1  ) in an elementary form , because in a single commodity ; (  2  ) with unity , because in one and the same commodity  .  This form of value is elementary and the same for all , therefore general  . \
The forms A and B were fit only to express the value of a commodity as something distinct from its use value or material form  . \
The first form , A , furnishes such equations as the following  :\'a0\'96 1 coat = 20 yards of linen , 10 lbs of tea = \'bd a ton of iron  . \'a0The value of the coat is equated to linen , that of the tea to iron  .  But to be equated to linen , and again to iron , is to be as different as are linen and iron  .  This form , it is plain , occurs practically only in the first beginning , when the products of labour are converted into commodities by accidental and occasional exchanges  . \
The second form , B , distinguishes , in a more adequate manner than the first , the value of a commodity from its use value , for the value of the coat is there placed in contrast under all possible shapes with the bodily form of the coat ; it is equated to linen , to iron , to tea , in short , to everything else , only not to itself , the coat  .  On the other hand , any general expression of value common to all is directly excluded ; for , in the equation of value of each commodity , all other commodities now appear only under the form of equivalents  .  The expanded form of value comes into actual existence for the first time so soon as a particular product of labour , such as cattle , is no longer exceptionally , but habitually , exchanged for various other commodities  . \
The third and lastly developed form expresses the values of the whole world of commodities in terms of a single commodity set apart for the purpose , namely , the linen , and thus represents to us their values by means of their equality with linen  .  The value of every commodity is now , by being equated to linen , not only differentiated from its own use value , but from all other use values generally , and is , by that very fact , expressed as that which is common to all commodities  .  By this form , commodities are , for the first time , effectively brought into relation with one another as values , or made to appear as exchange values  . \
The two earlier forms either express the value of each commodity in terms of a single commodity of a different kind , or in a series of many such commodities  .  In both cases , it is , so to say , the special business of each single commodity to find an expression for its value , and this it does without the help of the others  .  These others , with respect to the former , play the passive parts of equivalents  .  The general form of value , C , results from the joint action of the whole world of commodities , and from that alone  .  A commodity can acquire a general expression of its value only by all other commodities , simultaneously with it , expressing their values in the same equivalent ; and every new commodity must follow suit  .  It thus becomes evident that since the existence of commodities as values is purely social , this social existence can be expressed by the totality of their social relations alone , and consequently that the form of their value must be a socially recognised form  . \
All commodities being equated to linen now appear not only as qualitatively equal as values generally , but also as values whose magnitudes are capable of comparison  .  By expressing the magnitudes of their values in one and the same material , the linen , those magnitudes are also compared with each other  .  For instance , 10 lbs of tea = 20 yards of linen , and 40 lbs of coffee = 20 yards of linen  .  Therefore , 10 lbs of tea = 40 lbs of coffee  .  In other words , there is contained in 1 lb of coffee only one-fourth as much substance of value \'96 labour \'96 as is contained in 1 lb of tea  . \
The general form of relative value , embracing the whole world of commodities , converts the single commodity that is excluded from the rest , and made to play the part of equivalent \'96 here the linen \'96 into the universal equivalent  .  The bodily form of the linen is now the form assumed in common by the values of all commodities ; it therefore becomes directly exchangeable with all and every of them  .  The substance linen becomes the visible incarnation , the social chrysalis state of every kind of human labour  .  Weaving , which is the labour of certain private individuals producing a particular article , linen , acquires in consequence a social character , the character of equality with all other kinds of labour  .  The innumerable equations of which the general form of value is composed , equate in turn the labour embodied in the linen to that embodied in every other commodity , and they thus convert weaving into the general form of manifestation of undifferentiated human labour  .  In this manner the labour realised in the values of commodities is presented not only under its negative aspect , under which abstraction is made from every concrete form and useful property of actual work , but its own positive nature is made to reveal itself expressly  .  The general value form is the reduction of all kinds of actual labour to their common character of being human labour generally , of being the expenditure of human labour power  . \
The general value form , which represents all products of labour as mere congelations of undifferentiated human labour , shows by its very structure that it is the social resum\'e9 of the world of commodities  .  That form consequently makes it indisputably evident that in the world of commodities the character possessed by all labour of being\'a0human\'a0labour constitutes its specific social character  . \'a0\uc0\u8232 \
2  .  The Interdependent Development of the Relative Form of Value , and of the Equivalent Form\
The degree of development of the relative form of value corresponds to that of the equivalent form  .  But we must bear in mind that the development of the latter is only the expression and result of the development of the former  . \
The primary or isolated relative form of value of one commodity converts some other commodity into an isolated equivalent  .  The expanded form of relative value , which is the expression of the value of one commodity in terms of all other commodities , endows those other commodities with the character of particular equivalents differing in kind  .  And lastly , a particular kind of commodity acquires the character of universal equivalent , because all other commodities make it the material in which they uniformly express their value  . \
The antagonism between the relative form of value and the equivalent form , the two poles of the value form , is developed concurrently with that form itself  . \
The first form , 20 yds of linen = one coat , already contains this antagonism , without as yet fixing it  .  According as we read this equation forwards or backwards , the parts played by the linen and the coat are different  .  In the one case the relative value of the linen is expressed in the coat , in the other case the relative value of the coat is expressed in the linen  .  In this first form of value , therefore , it is difficult to grasp the polar contrast  . \
Form B shows that only one single commodity at a time can completely expand its relative value , and that it acquires this expanded form only because , and in so far as , all other commodities are , with respect to it , equivalents  .  Here we cannot reverse the equation , as we can the equation 20 yds of linen = 1 coat , without altering its general character , and converting it from the expanded form of value into the general form of value  . \
Finally , the form C gives to the world of commodities a general social relative form of value , because , and in so far as , thereby all commodities , with the exception of one , are excluded from the equivalent form  .  A single commodity , the linen , appears therefore to have acquired the character of direct exchangeability with every other commodity because , and in so far as , this character is denied to every other commodity  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#26"}}{\fldrslt  [ 26 ]}}\
The commodity that figures as universal equivalent , is , on the other hand , excluded from the relative value form  .  If the linen , or any other commodity serving as universal equivalent , were , at the same time , to share in the relative form of value , it would have to serve as its own equivalent  .  We should then have 20 yds of linen = 20 yds of linen ; this tautology expresses neither value , nor magnitude of value  .  In order to express the relative value of the universal equivalent , we must rather reverse the form\'a0C  .  This equivalent has no relative form of value in common with other commodities , but its value is relatively expressed by a never ending series of other commodities  . \'a0Thus , the expanded form of relative value , or form\'a0B , now shows itself as the specific form of relative value for the equivalent commodity  . \'a0\uc0\u8232 \
3  .  Transition from the General form of value to the Money form\
The universal equivalent form is a form of value in general  .  It can , therefore , be assumed by any commodity  .  On the other hand , if a commodity be found to have assumed the universal equivalent form (  form\'a0C  ) , this is only because and in so far as it has been excluded from the rest of all other commodities as their equivalent , and that by their own act  .  And from the moment that this exclusion becomes finally restricted to one particular commodity , from that moment only , the general form of relative value of the world of commodities obtains real consistence and general social validity  . \
The particular commodity , with whose bodily form the equivalent form is thus socially identified , now becomes the money commodity , or serves as money  .  It becomes the special social function of that commodity , and consequently its social monopoly , to play within the world of commodities the part of the universal equivalent  .  Amongst the commodities which , in form\'a0B , figure as particular equivalents of the linen , and , in form\'a0C , express in common their relative values in linen , this foremost place has been attained by one in particular \'96 namely , gold  .  If , then , in form\'a0C\'a0we replace the linen by gold , we get ,\'a0\uc0\u8232 \

In passing from form\'a0A\'a0to form\'a0B , and from the latter to form\'a0C , the changes are fundamental  .  On the other hand , there is no difference between forms\'a0C\'a0and\'a0D , except that , in the latter , gold has assumed the equivalent form in the place of linen  .  Gold is in form\'a0D , what linen was in form\'a0C\'a0\'96 the universal equivalent  .  The progress consists in this alone , that the character of direct and universal exchangeability \'96 in other words , that the universal equivalent form \'96 has now , by social custom , become finally identified with the substance , gold  . \
Gold is now money with reference to all other commodities only because it was previously , with reference to them , a simple commodity  .  Like all other commodities , it was also capable of serving as an equivalent , either as simple equivalent in isolated exchanges , or as particular equivalent by the side of others  .  Gradually it began to serve , within varying limits , as universal equivalent  .  So soon as it monopolises this position in the expression of value for the world of commodities , it becomes the money commodity , and then , and not till then , does form\'a0D\'a0become distinct from form\'a0C , and the general form of value become changed into the money form  . \
The elementary expression of the relative value of a single commodity , such as linen , in terms of the commodity , such as gold , that plays the part of money , is the price form of that commodity  .  The price form of the linen is therefore\
20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold , or , if 2 ounces of gold when\uc0\u8232 coined are \'a32 , 20 yards of linen = \'a32  . \
The difficulty in forming a concept of the money form , consists in clearly comprehending the universal equivalent form , and as a necessary corollary , the general form of value , form\'a0C  .  The latter is deducible from form\'a0B , the expanded form of value , the essential component element of which , we saw , is form\'a0A , 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or x commodity\'a0A\'a0= y commodity\'a0B  .  The simple commodity form is therefore the germ of the money form  . \

SECTION 4\
THE FETISHISM OF COMMODITIES\'a0\uc0\u8232 AND THE SECRET THEREOF\
\
\'a0\
A commodity appears , at first sight , a very trivial thing , and easily understood  .  Its analysis shows that it is , in reality , a very queer thing , abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties  .  So far as it is a value in use , there is nothing mysterious about it , whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants , or from the point that those properties are the product of human labour  .  It is as clear as noon-day , that man , by his industry , changes the forms of the materials furnished by Nature , in such a way as to make them useful to him  .  The form of wood , for instance , is altered , by making a table out of it  .  Yet , for all that , the table continues to be that common , every-day thing , wood  .  But , so soon as it steps forth as a commodity , it is changed into something transcendent  .  It not only stands with its feet on the ground , but , in relation to all other commodities , it stands on its head , and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas , far more wonderful than \'93table-turning\'94 ever was  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#26a"}}{\fldrslt  [ 26a ]}}\
The mystical character of commodities does not originate , therefore , in their use value  .  Just as little does it proceed from the nature of the determining factors of value  .  For , in the first place , however varied the useful kinds of labour , or productive activities , may be , it is a physiological fact , that they are functions of the human organism , and that each such function , whatever may be its nature or form , is essentially the expenditure of human brain , nerves , muscles , &c  .  Secondly , with regard to that which forms the ground-work for the quantitative determination of value , namely , the duration of that expenditure , or the quantity of labour , it is quite clear that there is a palpable difference between its quantity and quality  .  In all states of society , the labour time that it costs to produce the means of subsistence , must necessarily be an object of interest to mankind , though not of equal interest in different stages of development  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#27"}}{\fldrslt  [ 27 ]}}\'a0And lastly , from the moment that men in any way work for one another , their labour assumes a social form  . \
Whence , then , arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour , so soon as it assumes the form of commodities  ? Clearly from this form itself  .  The equality of all sorts of human labour is expressed objectively by their products all being equally values ; the measure of the expenditure of labour power by the duration of that expenditure , takes the form of the quantity of value of the products of labour ; and finally the mutual relations of the producers , within which the social character of their labour affirms itself , take the form of a social relation between the products  . \
A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing , simply because in it the social character of men\'92s labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour ; because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation , existing not between themselves , but between the products of their labour  .  This is the reason why the products of labour become commodities , social things whose qualities are at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses  .  In the same way the light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve , but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself  .  But , in the act of seeing , there is at all events , an actual passage of light from one thing to another , from the external object to the eye  .  There is a physical relation between physical things  .  But it is different with commodities  .  There , the existence of the things\'a0qu\'e2commodities , and the value relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities , have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom  . \'a0There it is a definite social relation between men , that assumes , in their eyes , the fantastic form of a relation between things  .  In order , therefore , to find an analogy , we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world  .  In that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life , and entering into relation both with one another and the human race  .  So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men\'92s hands  .  This I call the Fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour , so soon as they are produced as commodities , and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities  . \
This Fetishism of commodities has its origin , as the foregoing analysis has already shown , in the peculiar social character of the labour that produces them  . \
As a general rule , articles of utility become commodities , only because they are products of the labour of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of each other  .  The sum total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate labour of society  .  Since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products , the specific social character of each producer\'92s labour does not show itself except in the act of exchange  .  In other words , the labour of the individual asserts itself as a part of the labour of society , only by means of the relations which the act of exchange establishes directly between the products , and indirectly , through them , between the producers  .  To the latter , therefore , the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest appear , not as direct social relations between individuals at work , but as what they really are , material relations between persons and social relations between things  .  It is only by being exchanged that the products of labour acquire , as values , one uniform social status , distinct from their varied forms of existence as objects of utility  .  This division of a product into a useful thing and a value becomes practically important , only when exchange has acquired such an extension that useful articles are produced for the purpose of being exchanged , and their character as values has therefore to be taken into account , beforehand , during production  .  From this moment the labour of the individual producer acquires socially a two-fold character  .  On the one hand , it must , as a definite useful kind of labour , satisfy a definite social want , and thus hold its place as part and parcel of the collective labour of all , as a branch of a social division of labour that has sprung up spontaneously  .  On the other hand , it can satisfy the manifold wants of the individual producer himself , only in so far as the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private labour is an established social fact , and therefore the private useful labour of each producer ranks on an equality with that of all others  .  The equalisation of the most different kinds of labour can be the result only of an abstraction from their inequalities , or of reducing them to their common denominator , viz  .  expenditure of human labour power or human labour in the abstract  .  The two-fold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him , when reflected in his brain , only under those forms which are impressed upon that labour in every-day practice by the exchange of products  .  In this way , the character that his own labour possesses of being socially useful takes the form of the condition , that the product must be not only useful , but useful for others , and the social character that his particular labour has of being the equal of all other particular kinds of labour , takes the form that all the physically different articles that are the products of labour , have one common quality , viz  .  , that of having value  . \
Hence , when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each other as values , it is not because we see in these articles the material receptacles of homogeneous human labour  .  Quite the contrary  : whenever , by an exchange , we equate as values our different products , by that very act , we also equate , as human labour , the different kinds of labour expended upon them  .  We are not aware of this , nevertheless we do it  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#28"}}{\fldrslt  [ 28 ]}}\'a0Value , therefore , does not stalk about with a label describing what it is  .  It is value , rather , that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic  .  Later on , we try to decipher the hieroglyphic , to get behind the secret of our own social products ; for to stamp an object of utility as a value , is just as much a social product as language  .  The recent scientific discovery , that the products of labour , so far as they are values , are but material expressions of the human labour spent in their production , marks , indeed , an epoch in the history of the development of the human race , but , by no means , dissipates the mist through which the social character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the products themselves  .  The fact , that in the particular form of production with which we are dealing , viz  .  , the production of commodities , the specific social character of private labour carried on independently , consists in the equality of every kind of that labour , by virtue of its being human labour , which character , therefore , assumes in the product the form of value \'96 this fact appears to the producers , notwithstanding the discovery above referred to , to be just as real and final , as the fact , that , after the discovery by science of the component gases of air , the atmosphere itself remained unaltered  . \
What , first of all , practically concerns producers when they make an exchange , is the question , how much of some other product they get for their own  ? In what proportions the products are exchangeable  ? When these proportions have , by custom , attained a certain stability , they appear to result from the nature of the products , so that , for instance , one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of their different physical and chemical qualities appear to be of equal weight  .  The character of having value , when once impressed upon products , obtains fixity only by reason of their acting and re-acting upon each other as quantities of value  .  These quantities vary continually , independently of the will , foresight and action of the producers  .  To them , their own social action takes the form of the action of objects , which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them  .  It requires a fully developed production of commodities before , from accumulated experience alone , the scientific conviction springs up , that all the different kinds of private labour , which are carried on independently of each other , and yet as spontaneously developed branches of the social division of labour , are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which society requires them  .  And why  ? Because , in the midst of all the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange relations between the products , the labour time socially necessary for their production forcibly asserts itself like an over-riding law of Nature  .  The law of gravity thus asserts itself when a house falls about our ears  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#29"}}{\fldrslt  [ 29 ]}}\'a0The determination of the magnitude of value by labour time is therefore a secret , hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of commodities  .  Its discovery , while removing all appearance of mere accidentality from the determination of the magnitude of the values of products , yet in no way alters the mode in which that determination takes place  . \
Man\'92s reflections on the forms of social life , and consequently , also , his scientific analysis of those forms , take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development  .  He begins ,\'a0post festum , with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him  .  The characters that stamp products as commodities , and whose establishment is a necessary preliminary to the circulation of commodities , have already acquired the stability of natural , self-understood forms of social life , before man seeks to decipher , not their historical character , for in his eyes they are immutable , but their meaning  .  Consequently it was the analysis of the prices of commodities that alone led to the determination of the magnitude of value , and it was the common expression of all commodities in money that alone led to the establishment of their characters as values  .  It is , however , just this ultimate money form of the world of commodities that actually conceals , instead of disclosing , the social character of private labour , and the social relations between the individual producers  .  When I state that coats or boots stand in a relation to linen , because it is the universal incarnation of abstract human labour , the absurdity of the statement is self-evident  .  Nevertheless , when the producers of coats and boots compare those articles with linen , or , what is the same thing , with gold or silver , as the universal equivalent , they express the relation between their own private labour and the collective labour of society in the same absurd form  . \
The categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms  .  They are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite , historically determined mode of production , viz  .  , the production of commodities  .  The whole mystery of commodities , all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of commodities , vanishes therefore , so soon as we come to other forms of production  . \
Since Robinson Crusoe\'92s experiences are a favourite theme with political economists ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#30"}}{\fldrslt  [ 30 ]}}\'a0let us take a look at him on his island  .  Moderate though he be , yet some few wants he has to satisfy , and must therefore do a little useful work of various sorts , such as making tools and furniture , taming goats , fishing and hunting  .  Of his prayers and the like we take no account , since they are a source of pleasure to him , and he looks upon them as so much recreation  .  In spite of the variety of his work , he knows that his labour , whatever its form , is but the activity of one and the same Robinson , and consequently , that it consists of nothing but different modes of human labour  .  Necessity itself compels him to apportion his time accurately between his different kinds of work  .  Whether one kind occupies a greater space in his general activity than another , depends on the difficulties , greater or less as the case may be , to be overcome in attaining the useful effect aimed at  .  This our friend Robinson soon learns by experience , and having rescued a watch , ledger , and pen and ink from the wreck , commences , like a true-born Briton , to keep a set of books  .  His stock-book contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him , of the operations necessary for their production ; and lastly , of the labour time that definite quantities of those objects have , on an average , cost him  .  All the relations between Robinson and the objects that form this wealth of his own creation , are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without exertion , even to Mr  .  Sedley Taylor  .  And yet those relations contain all that is essential to the determination of value  . \
Let us now transport ourselves from Robinson\'92s island bathed in light to the European middle ages shrouded in darkness  .  Here , instead of the independent man , we find everyone dependent , serfs and lords , vassals and suzerains , laymen and clergy  .  Personal dependence here characterises the social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of life organised on the basis of that production  .  But for the very reason that personal dependence forms the ground-work of society , there is no necessity for labour and its products to assume a fantastic form different from their reality  .  They take the shape , in the transactions of society , of services in kind and payments in kind  .  Here the particular and natural form of labour , and not , as in a society based on production of commodities , its general abstract form is the immediate social form of labour  .  Compulsory labour is just as properly measured by time , as commodity-producing labour ; but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord , is a definite quantity of his own personal labour power  .  The tithe to be rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing  .  No matter , then , what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people themselves in this society , the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour , appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations , and are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labour  . \
For an example of labour in common or directly associated labour , we have no occasion to go back to that spontaneously developed form which we find on the threshold of the history of all civilised races  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#31"}}{\fldrslt  [ 31 ]}}\'a0We have one close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family , that produces corn , cattle , yarn , linen , and clothing for home use  .  These different articles are , as regards the family , so many products of its labour , but as between themselves , they are not commodities  .  The different kinds of labour , such as tillage , cattle tending , spinning , weaving and making clothes , which result in the various products , are in themselves , and such as they are , direct social functions , because functions of the family , which , just as much as a society based on the production of commodities , possesses a spontaneously developed system of division of labour  .  The distribution of the work within the family , and the regulation of the labour time of the several members , depend as well upon differences of age and sex as upon natural conditions varying with the seasons  .  The labour power of each individual , by its very nature , operates in this case merely as a definite portion of the whole labour power of the family , and therefore , the measure of the expenditure of individual labour power by its duration , appears here by its very nature as a social character of their labour  . \
Let us now picture to ourselves , by way of change , a community of free individuals , carrying on their work with the means of production in common , in which the labour power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community  .  All the characteristics of Robinson\'92s labour are here repeated , but with this difference , that they are social , instead of individual  .  Everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own personal labour , and therefore simply an object of use for himself  .  The total product of our community is a social product  .  One portion serves as fresh means of production and remains social  .  But another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence  .  A distribution of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary  .  The mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organisation of the community , and the degree of historical development attained by the producers  .  We will assume , but merely for the sake of a parallel with the production of commodities , that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence is determined by his labour time  .  Labour time would , in that case , play a double part  .  Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community  .  On the other hand , it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual , and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption  .  The social relations of the individual producers , with regard both to their labour and to its products , are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible , and that with regard not only to production but also to distribution  . \
The religious world is but the reflex of the real world  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#note"}}{\fldrslt  [ note ]}}\'a0And for a society based upon the production of commodities , in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as commodities and values , whereby they reduce their individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labour \'96 for such a society , Christianity with its\'a0cultus\'a0of abstract man , more especially in its bourgeois developments , Protestantism , Deism , &c  .  , is the most fitting form of religion  .  In the ancient Asiatic and other ancient modes of production , we find that the conversion of products into commodities , and therefore the conversion of men into producers of commodities , holds a subordinate place , which , however , increases in importance as the primitive communities approach nearer and nearer to their dissolution  .  Trading nations , properly so called , exist in the ancient world only in its interstices , like the gods of Epicurus in the Intermundia , or like Jews in the pores of Polish society  .  Those ancient social organisms of production are , as compared with bourgeois society , extremely simple and transparent  .  But they are founded either on the immature development of man individually , who has not yet severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen in a primitive tribal community , or upon direct relations of subjection  .  They can arise and exist only when the development of the productive power of labour has not risen beyond a low stage , and when , therefore , the social relations within the sphere of material life , between man and man , and between man and Nature , are correspondingly narrow  .  This narrowness is reflected in the ancient worship of Nature , and in the other elements of the popular religions  .  The religious reflex of the real world can , in any case , only then finally vanish , when the practical relations of every-day life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his fellowmen and to Nature  . \
The life-process of society , which is based on the process of material production , does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men , and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan  .  This , however , demands for society a certain material ground-work or set of conditions of existence which in their turn are the spontaneous product of a long and painful process of development  . \
Political Economy has indeed analysed , however incompletely ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#32"}}{\fldrslt  [ 32 ]}}\'a0value and its magnitude , and has discovered what lies beneath these forms  .  But it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour time by the magnitude of that value  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#33"}}{\fldrslt  [ 33 ]}}\'a0These formul\'e6 , which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society , in which the process of production has the mastery over man , instead of being controlled by him , such formul\'e6 appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself  .  Hence forms of social production that preceded the bourgeois form , are treated by the bourgeoisie in much the same way as the Fathers of the Church treated pre-Christian religions  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#34"}}{\fldrslt  [ 34 ]}}\
To what extent some economists are misled by the Fetishism inherent in commodities , or by the objective appearance of the social characteristics of labour , is shown , amongst other ways , by the dull and tedious quarrel over the part played by Nature in the formation of exchange value  .  Since exchange value is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of labour bestowed upon an object , Nature has no more to do with it , than it has in fixing the course of exchange  . \
The mode of production in which the product takes the form of a commodity , or is produced directly for exchange , is the most general and most embryonic form of bourgeois production  .  It therefore makes its appearance at an early date in history , though not in the same predominating and characteristic manner as now-a-days  .  Hence its Fetish character is comparatively easy to be seen through  .  But when we come to more concrete forms , even this appearance of simplicity vanishes  .  Whence arose the illusions of the monetary system  ? To it gold and silver , when serving as money , did not represent a social relation between producers , but were natural objects with strange social properties  .  And modern economy , which looks down with such disdain on the monetary system , does not its superstition come out as clear as noon-day , whenever it treats of capital  ? How long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion , that rents grow out of the soil and not out of society  ?\
But not to anticipate , we will content ourselves with yet another example relating to the commodity form  .  Could commodities themselves speak , they would say  : Our use value may be a thing that interests men  .  It is no part of us as objects  .  What , however , does belong to us as objects , is our value  .  Our natural intercourse as commodities proves it  .  In the eyes of each other we are nothing but exchange values  .  Now listen how those commodities speak through the mouth of the economist  . \
\'93Value\'94 \'96 (  i  . e  .  , exchange value  ) \'93is a property of things , riches\'94 \'96 (  i  . e  .  , use value  ) \'93of man  .  Value , in this sense , necessarily implies exchanges , riches do not  . \'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#35"}}{\fldrslt  [ 35 ]}}\'a0\'93Riches\'94 (  use value  ) \'93are the attribute of men , value is the attribute of commodities  .  A man or a community is rich , a pearl or a diamond is valuable  .   .   . \'94 A pearl or a diamond is valuable as a pearl or a diamond  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#36"}}{\fldrslt  [ 36 ]}}\
So far no chemist has ever discovered exchange value either in a pearl or a diamond  .  The economic discoverers of this chemical element , who by-the-bye lay special claim to critical acumen , find however that the use value of objects belongs to them independently of their material properties , while their value , on the other hand , forms a part of them as objects  .  What confirms them in this view , is the peculiar circumstance that the use value of objects is realised without exchange , by means of a direct relation between the objects and man , while , on the other hand , their value is realised only by exchange , that is , by means of a social process  .  Who fails here to call to mind our good friend , Dogberry , who informs neighbour Seacoal , that , \'93To be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune ; but reading and writing comes by Nature  . \'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#37"}}{\fldrslt  [ 37 ]}}\
Thanks to the economic and political development of France since  [ the French Revolution of ] 1789 , for 50 years the position of Paris has been such that no revolutions could break out there without assuming a proletarian character , that is to say , the proletariat , which had bought victory with its blood , would advance its own demands after victory  .  These demands were more or less unclear and even confused , corresponding to the state of evolution reached by the workers of Paris at the particular period , but in the last resort they all amounted to the abolition of the class antagonism between capitalist and workers  .  It is true that no one knew how this was to be brought about  .  But the demand itself , however indefinite it still was in its formulation , contained a threat to the existing order of society ; the workers who put it forward were still armed ; therefore the disarming of the workers was the first commandment for the bourgeois at the helm of the state  .  Hence , after every revolution won by the workers , a new struggle , ending with the defeat of the workers  . \
This happened for the first time in 1848  .  The liberal bourgeoisie of the parliamentary opposition held banquets for securing reform of the franchise , which was to ensure supremacy for their party  .  Forced more and more , in their struggle with the government , to appeal to the people , they had to allow the radical and republican strata of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie gradually to take the lead  .  But behind these stood the revolutionary workers , and since 1830 ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/intro.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\'a0these had acquired far more political independence than the bourgeoisie , and even the republicans , suspected  .  At the moment of the crisis between the government and the opposition , the workers opened battle on the streets ;  [ King ] Louis Philippe vanished , and with him the franchise reform ; and in its place arose the republic , and indeed one which the victorious workers themselves designated as a \'93social\'94 republic  .  No one , however , was clear as to what this social republic was to imply ; not even the workers themselves  .  But they now had arms in their hands , and were a power in the state  .  Therefore , as soon as the bourgeois republicans in control felt something like firm ground under their feet , their first aim was to disarm the workers  .  This took place by driving them into the insurrection of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/j/u.htm#june-insurrection-1848"}}{\fldrslt June 1848}}\'a0by direct breach of faith , by open defiance and the attempt to banish the unemployed to a distant province  .  The government had taken care to have an overwhelming superiority of force  .  After five days\'92 heroic struggle , the workers were defeated  .  And then followed a blood-bath of the defenceless prisoners , the likes of which as not been seen since the days of the civil wars which ushered in the downfall of the Roman republic  .  It was the first time that the bourgeoisie showed to what insane cruelties of revenge it will be goaded the moment the proletariat dares to take its stand against them as a separate class , with its own interests and demands  .  And yet 1848 was only child\'92s play compared with their frenzy in 1871  . \
Punishment followed hard at heel  .  If the proletariat was not yet able to rule France , the bourgeoisie could no longer do so  .  At least not at that period , when the greater part of it was still monarchically inclined , and it was divided into three dynastic parties  [ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#legitimists"}}{\fldrslt Legitimists}} ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/o/r.htm#orleanists"}}{\fldrslt Orleanists}}\'a0and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/b/o.htm#bonapartism"}}{\fldrslt Bonapartists}} ] and a fourth republican party  .  Its internal dissensions allowed the adventurer\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/n/a.htm#napoleon-3"}}{\fldrslt Louis Bonaparte}}\'a0to take possession of all the commanding points \'96 army , police , administrative machinery \'96 and , on December 2 , 1851 ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/intro.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\'a0to explode the last stronghold of the bourgeoisie , the National Assembly  .  The Second Empire opened the exploitation of France by a gang of political and financial adventurers , but at the same time also an industrial development such as had never been possible under the narrow-minded and timorous system of Louis Philippe , with its exclusive domination by only a small section of the big bourgeoisie  .  Louis Bonaparte took the political power from the capitalists under the pretext of protecting them , the bourgeoisie , from the workers , and on the other hand the workers from them ; but in return his rule encouraged speculation and industrial activity \'96 in a word the rise and enrichment of the whole bourgeoisie to an extent hitherto unknown  .  To an even greater extent , it is true , corruption and mass robbery developed , clustering around the imperial court , and drawing their heavy percentages from this enrichment  . \
But the Second Empire was the appeal to the French chauvinism , the demand for the restoration of the frontiers of the First Empire , which had been lost in 1814 , or at least those of the First Republic  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/intro.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}\'a0A French empire within the frontiers of the old monarchy and , in fact , within the even more amputated frontiers of 1815 \'96 such a thing was impossible for any long duration of time  .  Hence the necessity for brief wars and extension of frontiers  .  But no extension of frontiers was so dazzling to the imagination of the French chauvinists as the extension to the German left bank of the Rhine  .  One square mile on the Rhine was more to them than ten in the Alps or anywhere else  .  Given the Second Empire , the demand for the restoration to France of the left bank of the Rhine , either all at once or piecemeal , was merely a question of time  .  The time came with the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 ; cheated of the anticipated \'93territorial compensation\'94 by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/b/i.htm#bismarck"}}{\fldrslt Bismarck}} , and by his own over-cunning , hesitating policy , there was now nothing left for Napoleon but war , which broke out in 1870 and drove him first to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/s/e.htm#sedan-battle"}}{\fldrslt Sedan}} , and then to Wilhelmshohe  [ prison ]  . \
The inevitable result was the Paris Revolution of September 4 , 1870  .  The empire collapsed like a house of cards , and the republic was again proclaimed  .  But the enemy was standing at the gates  [ of Paris ] ; the armies of the empire were either hopelessly beleaguered in Metz or held captive in Germany  .  In this emergency the people allowed the Paris Deputies to the former legislative body to constitute themselves into a \'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/f/r.htm#fgnd"}}{\fldrslt Government of National Defence}}  . \'94 This was the more readily conceded , since , for the purpose of defence , all Parisians capable of bearing arms had enrolled in the National Guard and were armed , so that now the workers constituted a great majority  .  But almost at once the antagonism between the almost completely bourgeois government and the armed proletariat broke into open conflict  .  On October 31 , workers\'92 battalions stormed the town hall , and captured some members of the government  .  Treachery , the government\'92s direct breach of its undertakings , and the interventions of some petty-bourgeois battalions set them free again , and in order not to occasion the outbreak of civil war inside a city which was already beleaguered by a foreign power , the former government was left in office  . \
At last on January 28 , 1871 , Paris , almost starving , capitulated but with honors unprecedented in the history of war  .  The forts were surrendered , the outer wall disarmed , the weapons of the regiments of the line and of the Mobile Guard were handed over , and they themselves considered prisoners of war  .  But the National Guard kept its weapons and guns , and only entered into an armistice with the victors , who themselves did not dare enter Paris in triumph  .  They only dared to occupy a tiny corner of Paris , which , into the bargain , consisted partly of public parks , and even this they only occupied for a few days  ! And during this time they , who had maintained their encirclement of Paris for 131 days , were themselves encircled by the armed workers of Paris , who kept a sharp watch that no \'93Prussian\'94 should overstep the narrow bounds of the corner ceded to the foreign conquerors  .  Such was the respect which the Paris workers inspired in the army before which all the armies of the empire had laid down their arms ; and the Prussian\'a0Junkers , who had come to take revenge at the very centre of the revolution , were compelled to stand by respectfully , and salute just precisely this armed revolution  !\
During the war the Paris workers had confined themselves to demanding the vigorous prosecution of the fight  .  But now , when peace had come after the capitulation of Paris ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/intro.htm#D"}}{\fldrslt  [ D ]}}\'a0now ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/t/h.htm#thiers-louis-adolphe"}}{\fldrslt Thiers}} , the new head of government , was compelled to realize that the supremacy of the propertied classes \'96 large landowners and capitalists \'96 was in constant danger so long as the workers of Paris had arms in their hands  .  His first action was to attempt to disarm them  .  On March 18 , he sent troops of the line with orders to rob the National Guard of the artillery belonging to it , which had been constructed during the siege of Paris and had been paid for by public subscription  .  The attempt failed ; Paris mobilized as one man in defence of the guns , and war between Paris and the French government sitting at Versailles was declared  .  On March 26 the Paris Commune was elected and on March 28 it was proclaimed  .  The Central Committee of the National Guard , which up to then had carried on the government , handed in its resignation to the National Guard , after it had first decreed the abolition of the scandalous Paris \'93Morality Police  . \'94 On March 30 the Commune abolished conscription and the standing army , and declared that the National Guard , in which all citizens capable of bearing arms were to be enrolled , was to be the sole armed force  .  It remitted all payments of rent for dwelling houses from October 1870 until April , the amounts already paid to be reckoned to a future rental period , and stopped all sales of articles pledged in the municipal pawnshops  .  On the same day the foreigners elected to the Commune were confirmed in office , because \'93the flag of the Commune is the flag of the World Republic  . \'94\
On April 1 it was decided that the highest salary received by any employee of the Commune , and therefore also by its members themselves , might not exceed 6 ,000 francs  .  On the following day the Commune decreed the separation of the Church from the State , and the abolition of all state payments for religious purposes as well as the transformation of all Church property into national property ; as a result of which , on April 8 , a decree excluding from the schools all religious symbols , pictures , dogmas , prayers \'96 in a word , \'93all that belongs to the sphere of the individual\'92s conscience\'94 \'96 was ordered to be excluded from the schools , and this decree was gradually applied  .  On the 5th , in reply to the shooting , day after day , of the Commune\'92s fighters captured by the Versailles troops , a decree was issued for imprisonment of hostages , but it was never carried into effect  .  On the 6th , the guillotine was brought out by the 137th battalion of the National Guard , and publicly burnt , amid great popular rejoicing  .  On the 12th , the Commune decided that the Victory Column on the Place Vend\'f4me , which had been cast from guns captured by Napoleon after the war of 1809 , should be demolished as a symbol of chauvinism and incitement to national hatred  .  This decree was carried out on May 16  .  On April 16 the Commune ordered a statistical tabulation of factories which had been closed down by the manufacturers , and the working out of plans for the carrying on of these factories by workers formerly employed in them , who were to be organized in co-operative societies , and also plans for the organization of these co-operatives in one great union  .  On the 20th the Commune abolished night work for bakers , and also the workers\'92 registration cards , which since the Second Empire had been run as a monopoly by police nominees \'96 exploiters of the first rank ; the issuing of these registration cards was transferred to the mayors of the 20\'a0arrondissements\'a0of Paris  .  On April 30 , the Commune ordered the closing of the pawnshops , on the ground that they were a private exploitation of labor , and were in contradiction with the right of the workers to their instruments of labor and to credit  .  On May 5 it ordered the demolition of the Chapel of Atonement , which had been built in expiation of the execution of Louis XVI  . \
Thus , from March 18 onwards the class character of the Paris movement , which had previously been pushed into the background by the fight against the foreign invaders , emerged sharply and clearly  .  As almost without exception , workers , or recognized representatives of the workers , sat in the Commune , its decision bore a decidedly proletarian character  .  Either they decreed reforms which the republican bourgeoisie had failed to pass solely out of cowardice , but which provided a necessary basis for the free activity of the working class \'96 such as the realization of the principle that\'a0in relation to the state , religion is a purely private matter \'96 or they promulgated decrees which were in the direct interests of the working class and to some extent cut deeply into the old order of society  .  In a beleaguered city , however , it was possible at most to make a start in the realization of all these measures  .  And from the beginning of May onwards all their energies were taken up by the fight against the ever-growing armies assembled by the Versailles government  . \
On April 7 , the Versailles troops had captured the Seine crossing at Neuilly , on the western front of Paris ; on the other hand , in an attack on the southern front on the 11th they were repulsed with heavy losses by General Eudes  .  Paris was continually bombarded and , moreover , by the very people who had stigmatized as a sacrilege the bombardment of the same city by the Prussians  .  These same people now begged the Prussian government for the hasty return of the French soldiers taken prisoner at Sedan and Metz , in order that they might recapture Paris for them  .  From the beginning of May the gradual arrival of these troops gave the Versailles forces a decided ascendancy  .  This already became evident when , on April 23 , Thiers broke off the negotiations for the exchange , proposed by Commune , of the Archbishop of Paris  [ Georges Darboy ] and a whole number of other priests held hostages in Paris , for only one man , Blanqui , who had twice been elected to the Commune but was a prisoner in Clairvaux  .  And even more from the changed language of Thiers ; previously procrastinating and equivocal , he now suddenly became insolent , threatening , brutal  .  The Versailles forces took the redoubt of Moulin Saquet on the southern front , on May 3 ; on the 9th , Fort Issy , which had been completely reduced to ruins by gunfire ; and on the 14th , Fort Vanves  .  On the western front they advanced gradually , capturing the numerous villages and buildings which extended up to the city wall , until they reached the main wall itself ; on the 21st , thanks to treachery and the carelessness of the National Guards stationed there , they succeeded in forcing their way into the city  .  The Prussians who held the northern and eastern forts allowed the Versailles troops to advance across the land north of the city , which was forbidden ground to them under the armistice , and thus to march forward and attack on a long front , which the Parisians naturally thought covered by the armistice , and therefore held only with weak forces  .  As a result of this , only a weak resistance was put up in the western half of Paris , in the luxury city proper ; it grew stronger and more tenacious the nearer the incoming troops approached the eastern half , the real working class city  . \
It was only after eight days\'92 fighting that the last defender of the Commune were overwhelmed on the heights of Belleville and Menilmontant ; and then the massacre of defenceless men , women , and children , which had been raging all through the week on an increasing scale , reached its zenith  .  The breechloaders could no longer kill fast enough ; the vanquished workers were shot down in hundred by mitrailleuse fire  [ over 30 ,000 citizens of Paris were massacred ]  .  The \'93Wall of the Federals\'94  [ aka Wall of the Communards ] at the Pere Lachaise cemetery , where the final mass murder was consummated , is still standing today , a mute but eloquent testimony to the savagery of which the ruling class is capable as soon as the working class dares to come out for its rights  .  Then came the mass arrests  [ 38 ,000 workers arrested ] ; when the slaughter of them all proved to be impossible , the shooting of victims arbitrarily selected from the prisoners\'92 ranks , and the removal of the rest to great camps where they awaited trial by courts-martial  .  The Prussian troops surrounding the northern half of Paris had orders not to allow any fugitives to pass ; but the officers often shut their eyes when the soldiers paid more obedience to the dictates of humanity than to those of the General Staff ; particularly , honor is due to the Saxon army corps , which behaved very humanely and let through many workers who were obviously fighters for the Commune  . \
In the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm"}}{\fldrslt Inaugural Address}}\'a0of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/iwma/index.htm"}}{\fldrslt International Working Men\'92s Association}} , of November 1864 , we said  :\
\'93If the emancipation of the working classes requires their fraternal concurrence , how are they to fulfill that great mission with a foreign policy in pursuit of criminal designs , playing upon national prejudices , and squandering in piratical wars the people\'92s blood and treasure  ?\'94\
We defined the foreign policy aimed at by the International in these words  :\
\'93Vindicate the simple laws of morals and justice , which ought to govern the relations of private individuals , as the laws paramount of the intercourse of nations  . \'94\
No wonder that Louis Bonaparte , who usurped power by exploiting the war of classes in France , and perpetuated it by periodical wars abroad , should , from the first , have treated the International as a dangerous foe  .  On the eve of the plebiscite{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch01.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\'a0he ordered a raid on the members of the Administrative Committee of the International Working Men\'92s Association throughout France , at Paris , Lyons , Rouen , Marseilles , Brest , etc  .  , on the pretext that the International was a secret society dabbling in a\'a0complot\'a0for his assassination , a pretext soon after exposed in its full absurdity by his own judges  .  What was the real crime of the French branches of the International  ? They told the French people publicly and emphatically that voting the plebiscite was voting despotism at home and war abroad  .  It has been , in fact , their work that in all the great towns , in all the industrial centres of France , the working class rose like one man to reject the plebiscite  .  Unfortunately , the balance was turned by the heavy ignorance of the rural districts  .  The stock exchanges , the cabinets , the ruling classes , and the press of Europe celebrated the plebiscite as a signal victory of the French emperor over the French working class ; and it was the signal for the assassination , not of an individual , but of nations  . \
The war plot of July  [ 19 ] 1870{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch01.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\'a0is but an amended edition of the\'a0coup d\'92etat\'a0of December 1851  .  At first view , the thing seemed so absurd that France would not believe in its real good earnest  .  It rather believed the deputy denouncing the ministerial war talk as a mere stock-jobbing trick  .  When , on July 15 , war was at last officially announced to the\'a0Corps Legislatif , the whole Opposition refused to vote the preliminary subsidies \'96 even\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/t/h.htm#thiers-louis-adolphe"}}{\fldrslt Thiers}}\'a0branded it as \'93detestable\'94 ; all the independent journals of Paris condemned it , and , wonderful to relate , the provincial press joined in almost unanimously  . \
Meanwhile , the Paris members of the International had again set to work  .  In the\'a0Reveil\'a0of July 12 , they published their manifesto \'93to the Workmen of all Nations ,\'94 from which we extract the following few passages  :\
\'93Once more ,\'94 they say , \'93on the pretext of European equilibrium , of national honor , the peace of the world is menaced by political ambitions  .  French , German , Spanish workmen  ! Let our voices unite in one cry of reprobation against war  !\
 [   .   .   .  ]\
\'93War for a question of preponderance or a dynasty can , in the eyes of workmen , be nothing but a criminal absurdity  .  In answer to the warlike proclamations of those who exempt themselves from the blood tax , and find in public misfortunes a source of fresh speculations , we protest , we who want peace , labor , and liberty  !\
 [   .   .   .  ]\
\'93Brothers in Germany  ! Our division would only result in the complete triumph of the despotism on both sides of the Rhine  .   .   . \
\'93Workmen of all countries  ! Whatever may for the present become of our common efforts , we , the members of the International Working Men\'92s Association , who know of no frontiers , we send you , as a pledge of indissoluble solidarity , the good wishes and the salutations of the workmen of France  . \'94\
This manifesto of our Paris section was followed by numerous similar French addresses , of which we can here only quote the declaration of Neuilly-sur-Seine , published in the\'a0Marseillaise\'a0of July 22  :\
\'93The war , is it just  ? No  ! The war , is it national  ? No  ! It is merely dynastic  .  In the name of humanity , or democracy , and the true interests of France , we adhere completely and energetically to the protestation of the International against the war  . \'94\
These protestations expressed the true sentiments of the French working people , as was soon shown by a curious incident  .  The\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/d/e.htm#december-10-society"}}{\fldrslt Band of the 10th of December}} , first organized under the presidency of Louis Bonaparte , having been masqueraded into\'a0blouses\'a0 [ i  . e  .  , to appear as common workers ]\'a0and let loose on the streets of Paris , there to perform the contortions of war fever , the real workmen of the Faubourgs\'a0 [ suburbs , workers\'92 districts ]\'a0came forward with public peace demonstrations so overwhelming that Pietri , the Prefect of Police , thought it prudent to stop at once all further street politics , on the plea that the real Paris people had given sufficient vent to their pent-up patriotism and exuberant war enthusiasm  . \
Whatever may be the incidents of Louis Bonaparte\'92s war with Prussia , the death-knell of the Second Empire has already sounded at Paris  .  It will end , as it began , by a parody  .  But let us not forget that it is the governments and the ruling classes of Europe who enabled Louis Bonaparte to play during 18 years the ferocious farce of the Restored Empire  . \
On the German side , the war is a war of defence ; but who put Germany to the necessity of defending herself  ? Who enabled Louis Bonaparte to wage war upon her  ? Prussia  ! It was Bismarck who conspired with that very same Louis Bonaparte for the purpose of crushing popular opposition at home , and annexing Germany to the Hohenzollern dynasty  .  If the battle of Sadowa had been lost instead of being won , French battalions would have overrun Germany as the allies of Prussia  .  After her victory , did Prussia dream one moment of opposing a free Germany to an enslaved France  ? Just the contrary  .  While carefully preserving all the native beauties of her old system , she super-added all the tricks of the Second Empire , its real despotism , and its mock democratism , its political shams and its financial jobs , its high-flown talk and its low\'a0legerdemains  .  The Bonapartist regime , which till then only flourished on one side of the Rhine , had now got its counterfeit on the other  .  From such a state of things , what else could result but war  ?\
If the German working class allows the present war to lose its strictly defensive character and to degenerate into a war against the French people , victory of defeat will prove alike disastrous  .  All the miseries that befell Germany after her wars of independence will revive with accumulated intensity  . \
The principles of the International are , however , too widely spread and too firmly rooted amongst the German working class to apprehend such a sad consummation  .  The voices of the French workmen had re-echoed from Germany  .  A mass meeting of workmen , held at Brunswick on July 16 , expressed its full concurrence with the Paris manifesto , spurned the idea of national antagonism to France , and wound up its resolutions with these words  :\
\'93We are the enemies of all wars , but above all of dynastic wars  .    .   .   .  With deep sorrow and grief we are forced to undergo a defensive war as an unavoidable evil ; but we call , at the same time , upon the whole German working class to render the recurrence of such an immense social misfortune impossible by vindicating for the peoples themselves the power to decide on peace and war , and making them masters of their own destinies  . \'94\
At Chemnitz , a meeting of delegates , representing 50 ,000 Saxon workmen , adopted unanimously a resolution to this effect  :\
\'93In the name of German Democracy , and especially of the workmen forming the Democratic Socialist Party , we declare the present war to be exclusively dynastic  .   .   .   .  We are happy to grasp the fraternal hand stretched out to us by the workmen of France  .   .   .   .  Mindful of the watchword of the International Working Men\'92s Association  : Proletarians of all countries , unite , we shall never forget that the workmen of all countries are our friends and the despots of all countries our enemies  . \'94\
The Berlin branch of the International has also replied to the Paris manifesto  :\
\'93We ,\'94 they say , \'93join with heart and hand your protestation  .   .   .   .  Solemnly , we promise that neither the sound of the trumpets , nor the roar of the cannon , neither victory nor defeat , shall divert us from our common work for the union of the children of toil of all countries  . \'94\
Be it so  !\
In the background of this suicidal strike looms the dark figure of Russia  .  It is an ominous sign that the signal for the present war should have been given at the moment when the Moscovite government had just finished its strategic lines of railway and was already massing troops in the direction of the Prut  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch01.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}\'a0Whatever sympathy the Germans may justly claim in a war of defense against Bonapartist aggression , they would forfeit at once by allowing the Prussian government to call for , or accept the help of , the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm#cossacks"}}{\fldrslt Cossack}}  .  Let them remember that after their war of independence against the first Napoleon , Germany lay for generations prostrate at the feet of the tsar  . \
The English working class stretch the hand of fellowship to the French and German working people  .  They feel deeply convinced that whatever turn the impending horrid war may take , the alliance of the working classes of all countries will ultimately kill war  .  The very fact that while official France and Germany are rushing into a fratricidal feud , the workmen of France and Germany send each other messages of peace and goodwill ; this great fact , unparalleled in the history of the past , opens the vista of a brighter future  .  It proves that in contrast to old society , with its economical miseries and its political delirium , a new society is springing up , whose International rule will be\'a0Peace , because its national ruler will be everywhere the same \'96 Labour  ! The pioneer of that new society is the International Working Men\'92s Association  . \
In our\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch01.htm"}}{\fldrslt first manifesto}}\'a0of the 23rd of July , we said  :\
\'a0\
\'93The death-knell of the Second Empire has already sounded at Paris  .  It will end , as it began , by a parody  .  But let us not forget that it is the governments and the ruling classes of Europe who enabled Louis Bonaparte to play during 18 years the ferocious farce of the Restored Empire  . \'94\
Thus , even before war operations had actually set in , we treated the Bonapartist bubble as a thing of the past  . \
If we were not mistaken as to the vitality of the Second Empire , we were not wrong in our apprehension lest the German war should \'93lose its strictly defensive character and degenerate into a war against the French people  . \'94 The war of defense ended , in point of fact , with the surrender of Louis Bonaparte , the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/s/e.htm#sedan-battle"}}{\fldrslt Sedan capitulation}} , and the proclamation of the republic at Paris  .  But long before these events , the very moment that the utter rottenness of the imperialist arms became evident , the Prussian military\'a0camarilla\'a0had resolved upon conquest  .  There lay an ugly obstacle in their way \'96  [ Prussian ] King William\'92s own proclamations at the commencement of the war  . \
In a speech from the throne to the North German Diet , he had solemnly declared to make war upon the emperor of the French and not upon the French nation , where he said  :\
\'93The Emperor Napoleon having made by land and sea an attack on the German nation , which desired and still desires to live in peace with the French people , I have assumed the command of the German armies to repel his aggression , and I have been led by military events to cross the frontiers of France  . \'94\
Not content to assert the defensive character of the war by the statement that he only assumed the command of the German armies \'93to repel aggression  "   , he added that he was only \'93led by military events\'94 to cross the frontiers of France  .  A defensive war does , of course , not exclude offensive operations , dictated by military events  . \
Thus , the pious king stood pledged before France and the world to a strictly defensive war  .  How to release him from his solemn pledge  ? The stage managers had to exhibit him as reluctantly yielding to the irresistible behest of the German nation  .  They at once gave the cue to the liberal German middle class , with its professors , its capitalists , its aldermen , and its penmen  .  That middle class , which , in its struggles for civil liberty , had , from 1846 to 1870 , been exhibiting an unexampled spectacle of irresolution , incapacity and cowardice , felt , of course , highly delighted to bestride the European scene as the roaring lion of German patriotism  .  It re-vindicated its civic independence by affecting to force upon the Prussian government the secret designs of that same government  .  It does penance for its long-continued , and almost religious , faith in Louis Bonaparte\'92s infallibility , but shouting for the dismemberment of the French republic  .  Let us , for a moment , listen to the special pleadings of those stout-hearted patriots  !\
They dare not pretend that the people of Alsace and Lorraine pant for the German embrace ; quite the contrary  .  To punish their French patriotism , Strasbourg , a town with an independent citadel commanding it , has for six days been wantonly and fiendishly bombarded by \'93German\'94 explosive shells , setting it on fire , and killing great numbers of its defenceless inhabitants  ! Yet , the soil of those provinces once upon a time belonged to the whilom German empire  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\'a0Hence , it seems , the soil and the human beings grown on it must be confiscated as imprescriptible German property  .  If the map of Europe is to be re-made in the antiquary\'92s vein , let us by no means forget that the Elector of Brandenburg , for his Prussian dominions , was the vassal of the Polish republic  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\
The more knowing patriots , however , require Alsace and the German-speaking Lorraine as a \'93material guarantee\'94 against French aggression  .  As this contemptible plea has bewildered many weak-minded people , we are bound to enter more fully upon it  . \
There is no doubt that the general configuration of Alsace , as compared with the opposite bank of the Rhine , and the presence of a large fortified town like Strasbourg , about halfway between Basle and Germersheim , very much favour a French invasion of South Germany , while they offer peculiar difficulties to an invasion of France from South Germany  .  There is , further , no doubt that the addition of Alsace and German-speaking Lorraine would give South Germany a much stronger frontier , inasmuch as she would then be the master of the crest of the Vosges mountains in its whole length , and of the fortresses which cover its northern passes  .  If Metz were annexed as well , France would certainly for the moment be deprived of her two principal bases of operation against Germany , but that would not prevent her from concentrating a fresh one at Nancy or Verdun  .  While Germany owns Coblenz , Mayence\'a0 [ i  . e  .  , Mainz ] , Germersheim , Rastatt , and Ulm , all bases of operation against France , and plentifully made use of in this war , with what show of fair play can she begrudge France Strasbourg and Metz , the only two fortresses of any importance she has on that side  ? Moreover , Strasbourg endangers South Germany only while South Germany is a separate power from North Germany  .  From 1792 to 1795 , South Germany was never invaded from that direction , because Prussia was a party to the war against the French Revolution ; but as soon as Prussia made a peace of her own{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}\'a0in 1795 , and left the South to shift for itself , the invasions of South Germany with Strasbourg as a base began and continued till 1809  .  The fact is , a\'a0unitedGermany can always render Strasbourg and any French army in Alsace innocuous by concentrating all her troops , as was done in the present war , between Saarlouis and Landau , and advancing , or accepting battle , on the line of road between Mayence and Metz  .  While the mass of the German troops is stationed there , any French army advancing from Strasbourg into South Germany would be outflanked , and have its communication threatened  .  If the present campaign has proved anything , it is the facility of invading France from Germany  . \
But , in good faith , is it not altogether an absurdity and an anachronism to make military considerations the principle by which the boundaries of nations are to be fixed  ? If this rule were to prevail , Austria would still be entitled to Venetia and the line of the Minicio , and France to the line of the Rhine , in order to protect Paris , which lies certainly more open to an attack from the northeast than Berlin does from the southwest  .  If limits are to be fixed by military interests , there will be no end to claims , because every military line is necessarily faulty , and may be improved by annexing some more outlying territory ; and , moreover , they can never be fixed finally and fairly , because they always must be imposed by the conqueror upon the conquered , and consequently carry within them the seed of fresh wars  . \
Such is the lesson of all history  . \
Thus with nations as with individuals  .  To deprive them of the power of offence , you must deprive them of the means of defence  .  You must not only garrote , but murder  .  If every conqueror took \'93material guarantees  "   for breaking the sinews of a nation , the first Napoleon did so by the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/t/i.htm#tilsit-treaty"}}{\fldrslt Tilsit Treaty}} , and the way he executed it against Prussia and the rest of Germany  .  Yet , a few years later , his gigantic power split like a rotten reed upon the German people  .  What are the \'93material guarantees\'94 Prussia , in her wildest dreams , can or dare imposes upon France , compared to the \'93material guarantees\'94 the first Napoleon had wrenched from herself  ? The result will not prove the less disastrous  .  History will measure its retribution , not by the intensity of the square miles conquered from France , but by the intensity of the crime of reviving , in the second half of the 19th century ,\'a0the policy of conquest  !\
But , say the mouthpieces of Teutonic  [ German ] patriotism , you must not confound Germans with Frenchmen  .  What\'a0we\'a0want is not glory , but safety  .  The Germans are an essentially peaceful people  .  In their sober guardianship , conquest itself changes from a condition of future war into a pledge of perpetual peace  .  Of course , it is not Germans that invaded France in 1792 , for the sublime purpose of bayonetting the revolution of the 18th century  .  It is not Germans that befouled their hands by the subjugation of Italy , the oppressions of Hungary , and the dismemberment of Poland  .  Their present military system , which divides the whole able-bodied male population into two parts \'96 one standing army on service , and another standing army on furlough , both equally bound in passive obedience to rulers by divine right \'96 such a military system is , of course , \'93a material guarantee ,\'94 for keeping the peace and the ultimate goal of civilizing tendencies  ! In Germany , as everywhere else , the sycophants of the powers that be poison the popular mind by the incense of mendacious self-praise  . \
Indignant as they pretend to be at the sight of French fortresses in Metz and Strasbourg , those German patriots see no harm in the vast system of Moscovite fortifications at Warsaw , Modlin , and Ivangorod\'a0 [ All strongholds of the Russian Empire ]\'a0  .  While gloating at the terrors of imperialist invasion , they blink at the infamy of autocratic tutelage  . \
As in 1865 , promises were exchanged between Gorchakov and Bismarck  .  As Louis Bonaparte flattered himself that the War of 1866 , resulting in the common exhaustion of Austria and Prussia , would make him the supreme arbiter of Germany , so Alexander  [ II of Russia ] flattered himself that the War of 1870 , resulting in the common exhaustion of Germany and France , would make him the supreme arbiter of the Western continent  .  As the Second Empire thought the North German Confederation incompatible with its existence , so autocratic Russia must think herself endangered by a German empire under Prussian leadership  .  Such is the law of the old political system  .  Within its pale the gain of one state is the loss of the other  .  The tsar\'92s paramount influence over Europe roots in his traditional hold on Germany  .  At a moment when in Russia herself volcanic social agencies threaten to shake the very base of autocracy , could the tsar afford to bear with such a loss of foreign prestige  ? Already the Moscovite journals repeat the language of the Bonapartist journals of the War of 1866  .  Do the Teuton patriots really believe that liberty and peace will be guaranteed to Germany by forcing France into the arms of Russia  ? If the fortune of her arms , the arrogance of success , and dynastic intrigue lead Germany to a dismemberment of French territory , there will then only remain two courses open to her  . \'a0She must at all risks become the\'a0avowed\'a0tool of Russian aggrandizement , or , after some short respite , make again ready for another \'93defensive\'94 war , not one of those new-fangled \'93localized\'94 wars , but a\'a0war of races\'a0\'96 a war with the Slavonic and Roman races  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#D"}}{\fldrslt  [ D ]}}\
The German working class have resolutely supported the war , which it was not in their power to prevent , as a war for German independence and the liberation of France and Europe from that pestilential incubus , the Second Empire  .  It was the German workmen who , together with the rural laborers , furnished the sinews and muscles of heroic hosts , leaving behind their half-starved families  .  Decimated by the battles abroad , they will be once more decimated by misery at home  .  In their turn , they are now coming forward to ask for \'93guarantees\'94 \'96 guarantees that their immense sacrifices have not been bought in vain , that they have conquered liberty , that the victory over the imperialist armies will not , as in 1815 , be turned into the defeat of the German people{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#E"}}{\fldrslt  [ E ]}} ; and , as the first of these guarantees , they claim an\'a0honorable peace for France , and the\'a0recognition of the French republic  . \
The Central Committee of the German Social-Democratic Workmen\'92s Party issued , on September 5 , a manifesto , energetically insisting upon these guarantees  . \
\'a0\
\'93We ,\'94 they say , \'93protest against the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine  .  And we are conscious of speaking in the name of the German working class  .  In the common interest of France and Germany , in the interest of western civilization against eastern barbarism , the German workmen will not patiently tolerate the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine  .   .   .   .  We shall faithfully stand by our fellow workmen in all countries for the common international cause of the proletariat  !\'94\
Unfortunately , we cannot feel sanguine of their immediate success  .  If the French workmen amidst peace failed to stop the aggressor , are the German workmen more likely to stop the victor amidst the clamour of arms  ? The German workmen\'92s manifesto demands the extradition of Louis Bonaparte as a common felon to the French republic  .  Their rulers are , on the contrary , already trying hard to restore him to the Tuileries{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#F"}}{\fldrslt  [ F ]}}\'a0as the best man to ruin France  .  However that may be , history will prove that the German working class are not made of the same malleable stuff as the German middle class  .  They will do their duty  . \
Like them , we hail the advent of the republic in France , but at the same time we labor under misgivings which we hope will prove groundless  .  That republic has not subverted the throne , but only taken its place , become vacant  .  It has been proclaimed , not as a social conquest , but as a national measure of defence  .  It is in the hands of a Provisional Government composed partly of notorious\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/o/r.htm#orleanists"}}{\fldrslt Orleanists}} , partly of middle class republicans , upon some of whom the insurrection of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/j/u.htm#june-insurrection-1848"}}{\fldrslt June 1848}}\'a0has left its indelible stigma  .  The division of labor amongst the members of that government looks awkward  .  The Orleanists have seized the strongholds of the army and the police , while to the professed republicans have fallen the talking departments  .  Some of their acts go far to show that they have inherited from the empire , not only ruins , but also its dread of the working class  .  If eventual impossibilities are , in wild phraseology , promised in the name of the republic , is it not with a view to prepare the cry for a \'93possible\'94 government  ? Is the republic , by some of its middle class undertakers , not intended to serve as a mere stop-gap and bridge over an Orleanist restoration  ?\
The French working class moves , therefore , under circumstances of extreme difficulty  .  Any attempt at upsetting the new government in the present crisis , when the enemy is almost knocking at the doors of Paris , would be a desperate folly  .  The French workmen must perform their duties as citizens ; but , at the same time , they must not allow themselves to be swayed by the national\'a0souvenirs\'a0of 1792 , as the French peasant allowed themselves to be deluded by the national\'a0souvenirs\'a0of the First Empire  .  They have not to recapitulate the past , but to build up the future  .  Let them calmly and resolutely improve the opportunities of republican liberty , for the work of their own class organization  .  It will gift them with fresh herculean powers for the regeneration of France , and our common task \'96 the emancipation of labor  .  Upon their energies and wisdom hinges the fate of the republic  . \
The English workmen have already taken measures to overcome , by a wholesome pressure from without , the reluctance of their government to recognize the French republic  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#G"}}{\fldrslt  [ G ]}}\'a0The present dilatoriness of the British government is probably intended to atone for the Anti-Jacobin war  [ 1792 ] and the former indecent haste in sanctioning the coup d\'92etat  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#H"}}{\fldrslt  [ H ]}}\'a0The English workmen call also upon their government to oppose by all its power the dismemberment of France , which a part of the English press is shameless enough to howl for  .  It is the same press that for 20 years deified Louis Bonaparte as the providence of Europe , that frantically cheered on the slaveholders\'92 rebellion  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm#I"}}{\fldrslt  [ I ]}}\'a0Now , as then , it drudges for the slaveholder  . \
Let the sections of the International Working Men\'92s Association in every country stir the working classes to action  .  If they forsake their duty , if they remain passive , the present tremendous war will be but the harbinger of still deadlier international feuds , and lead in every nation to a renewed triumph over the workman by the lords of the sword , of the soil , and of capital  . \
In September 4 , 1870 , when the working men of Paris proclaimed the republic , which was almost instantaneously acclaimed throughout France , without a single voice of dissent , a cabal of place-hunting barristers , with Thiers for their statesman , and Trochu for their general , took hold of the Hotel de Ville  .  At that time they were imbued with so fanatical a faith in the mission of Paris to represent France in all epochs of historical crisis that , to legitimate their usurped titles as governors of France , they thought it quite sufficient to produce their lapsed mandates as representatives of Paris  . \
In our\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch02.htm"}}{\fldrslt second address}}\'a0on the late war , five days after the rise of these men , we told you who they were  .  Yet , in the turmoil of surprise , with the real leaders of the working class still shut up in Bonapartist prisons and the Prussians already marching on Paris , Paris bore with their assumption of power , on the express condition that it was to be wielded for the single purpose of national defence  .  Paris , however , was not to be defended without arming its working class , organizing them into an effective force , and training their ranks by the war itself  .  But Paris armed was the revolution armed  .  A victory of Paris over the Prussian aggressor would have been a victory of the French workmen over the French capitalist and his state parasites  .  In this conflict between national duty and class interest , the Government of National Defence did not hesitate one moment to turn into a Government of National Defection  . \
The first step they took was to send Thiers on a roving tour to all the courts of Europe , there to beg mediation by offering the barter of the republic for a king  .  Four months after the commencement of the siege  [ of Paris ] , when they thought the opportune moment came for breaking the first word of capitulation , Trochu , in the presence of Jules Favre , and others of his colleagues , addressed the assembled mayors of Paris in these terms  :\
\'93The first question put to me by my colleagues on the very evening of the 4th of September was this  : Paris , can it , with any chance of success , stand a siege by the Prussian army  ? I did not hesitate to answer in the negative  .  Some of my colleagues here present will warrant the truth of my words and the persistence of my opinion  .  I told them , in these very terms , that , under the existing state of things , the attempt of Paris to hold out a siege by the Prussian army would be a folly  .  Without doubt , I added , it would be an heroic folly ; but that would be all  .   .   .   .  The events  [ managed by himself ] have not given the lie to my prevision  . \'94\
This nice little speech of Trochu was afterwards published by M  .  Carbon , one of the mayors present  . \
Thus , on the very evening of the proclamation of the republic , Trochu\'92s \'93plan\'94 was known to his colleagues to be the capitulation of Paris  .  If national defence has been more than a pretext for the personal government of Thiers , Favre , and Co  .  , the upstarts of September 4 would have abdicated on the 5th \'96 would have initiated the Paris people into Trochu\'92s \'93plan ,\'94 and called upon them to surrender at once , or to take their own fate into their own hands  .  Instead of this , the infamous impostors resolved upon curing the heroic folly of Paris by a regimen of famine and broken heads , and to dupe her in the meanwhile by ranting manifestos , holding forth that Trochu , \'93the governor of Paris , will never capitulate  "   , and Jules Favre , the foreign minister , will \'93not cede an inch of our territory , nor a stone of our fortresses  . \'94\
In a letter to Gambetta , the very same Jules Favre avows that what they were \'93defending\'94 against were not the Prussian soldiers , but the working men of Paris  .  During the whole continuance of the siege , the Bonapartist cut-throats , whom Trochu had wisely entrusted with the command of the Paris army , exchanged , in their intimate correspondence , ribald jokes at the well-understood mockery of defence  .  (  See , for instance , the correspondence of Alphonse Simon Guiod , supreme commander of the artillery of the Army of Defence of Paris and Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor , to Suzanne , general of division of artillery , a correspondence published by the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/periodicals/r/e.htm#rfjo"}}{\fldrslt Journal officiel}}\'a0of the Commune  .   ) The mask of the true heroism was at last dropped on\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/f/r.htm#january-28"}}{\fldrslt January 28 , 1871}}  .  With the true heroism of utter self-debasement , the Government of National Defence , in their capitulation , came out as the government of France by Bismarck\'92s prisoners \'96 a part so base that Louis Bonaparte himself had , at Sedan , shrunk from accepting it  .  After the events of March 18 on their wild flight to Versailles , the\'a0capitulards\'a0left in the hands of Paris the documentary evidence of their treason , to destroy which , as the Commune says in its manifesto to the provinces , \'93those men would not recoil from battering Paris into a heap of ruins washed by a sea of blood  .   "  \
To be eagerly bent upon such a consummation , some of the leading members of the Government of Defence had , besides , most peculiar reasons of their own  . \
Shortly after the conclusion of the armistice , M  .  Milliere , one of the representatives of Paris to the National Assembly , now shot by express orders of Jules Favre , published a series of authentic legal documents in proof that Jules Favre , living in concubinage with the wife of a drunken resident at Algiers , had , by a most daring concoction of forgeries , spread over many years , contrived to grasp , in the name of the children of his adultery , a large succession , which made him a rich man , and that , in a lawsuit undertaken by the legitimate heirs , he only escaped exposure by the connivance of the Bonapartist tribunals  .  As these dry legal documents were not to be got rid of by any amount of rhetorical horse-power , Jules Favre , for the first time in his life , held his tongue , quietly awaiting the outbreak of the civil war , in order , then , frantically to denounce the people of Paris as a band of escaped convicts in utter revolt against family , religion , order , and property  .  This same forger had hardly got into power , after September 4 , when he sympathetically let loose upon society Pic and Taillefer , convicted , even under the empire , of forgery in the scandalous affair of \'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/periodicals/e/t.htm#l-etendard"}}{\fldrslt Etendard}}  . \'94 One of these men , Taillefer , having dared to return to Paris under the Commune , was at once reinstated in prison ; and then Jules Favre exclaimed , from the tribune of the National Assembly , that Paris was setting free all her jailbirds  !\
Ernest Picard , the Joe Miller of the Government of National Defence , who appointed himself Finance Minister of the republic after having in vain striven to become home minister of the empire , is the brother of one Arthur Picard , an individual expelled from the Paris\'a0Bourse\'a0as a blackleg (  see report of the Prefecture of Police , dated July 13 , 1867  ) , and convicted , on his own confession , of theft of 300 ,000 francs , while manager of one of the branches of the\'a0Societe Generale ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\'a0Rue Palestro , No  . 5 (  see report of the Prefecture of Police , dated December 11 , 1868  )  .  This Arthur Picard was made by Ernest Picard the editor of his paper ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/periodicals/e/l.htm#l-electeur-libre"}}{\fldrslt l\'92Electeur Libre}}  .  While the common run of stockjobbers were led astray by the official lies of this finance office paper , Arthur was running backwards and forwards between the finance office and the\'a0Bourse , there to discount the disasters of the French army  .  The whole financial correspondence of that worthy pair of brothers fell into the hands of the Commune  . \
Jules Ferry , a penniless barrister before September 4 , contrived , as mayor of Paris during the siege , to job a fortune out of famine  .  The day on which he would have to give an account of his maladministration would be the day of his conviction  . \
These men , then , could find in the ruins of Paris only their tickets-of-leave{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}} ; they were the very men Bismarck wanted  .  With the help of some shuffling of cards , Thiers , hitherto the secret prompter of the government , now appeared at its head , with the tickets-of-leave men for his ministers  . \
Theirs , that monstrous gnome , has charmed the French bourgeoisie for almost half a century , because he is the most consummate intellectual expression of their own class corruption  .  Before he became a statesman , he had already proved his lying powers as an historian  .  The chronicle of his public life is the record of the misfortunes of France  .  Banded , before 1830 , with the republicans , he slipped into office under Louis Philippe by betraying his protector Lafitte , ingratiating himself with the king by exciting mob riots against the clergy , during which the church of Saint Germain l\'92Auxerrois and the Archbishop\'92s palace were plundered , and by acting the minister-spy upon , and the jail-accoucheur\'a0of the Duchess de Berry  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\'a0The massacre of the republicans in the Rue Transnonian , and the subsequent infamous laws of September against the press and the right of association , were his work  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}\'a0Reappearing as the chief of the cabinet in March 1840 , he astonished France with his plan for fortifying France  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#D"}}{\fldrslt  [ D ]}}\'a0To the republicans , who denounced this plan as a sinister plot against the liberty of Paris , he replied from the tribune of the Chamber of Deputies  :\
\'93What  ! To fancy that any works of fortification could ever endanger liberty  ! And first of all you calumniate any possible government in supposing that it could some day attempt to maintain itself by bombarding the capital ;  [   .   .   .  ] but that the government would be a hundred times more impossible after its victory than before  . \'94\
Indeed , no government would ever have dared to bombard Paris from the forts , save that government which had previously surrendered these forts to the Prussians  . \
When King Bomba  [ Ferdinand II of Spain ] tried his hand at Palermo , in January 1848 , Thiers , then long since out of office , again rose in the Chamber of Deputies  :\
\'93You know , gentlemen , what is happening at Palermo  .  You , all of you , shake with horror  [ in the parliamentary sense ] on hearing that during 48 hours a large town has been bombarded \'96 by whom  ? Was it a foreign enemy exercising the rights of war  ? No , gentlemen , it was by its own government  .  And why  ? Because the unfortunate town demanded its rights  .  Well , then , for the demand of its rights it has got 48 hours of bombardment  .   .   .   .  Allow me to appeal to the opinion of Europe  .  It is doing a service to mankind to arise , and to make reverberate , from what is perhaps the greatest tribune in Europe , some words  [ indeed words ] of indignation against such acts  .   .   .   .  When the Regent Espartero , who had rendered services to his country  [ which M  .  Thiers never did ] intended bombarding Barcelona , in order to suppress its insurrection , there arose from all parts of the world a general outcry of indignation  . \'94\
Eighteen months afterwards , M  .  Thiers was amongst the fiercest defenders of the bombardment of Rome by a French army  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#E"}}{\fldrslt  [ E ]}}\'a0In fact , the fault of King Bomba seems to have consisted in this only \'96 that he limited his bombardment to 48 hours  . \
A few days before the February Revolution , fretting at the long exile from place and pelf to which Guizot had condemned him , and sniffing in the air the scent of an approaching popular commotion , Thiers , in that pseudo-heroic style which won him the nickname\'a0Mirabeau-mouche\'a0 [ Mirabeau the fly ] , declared , to the Chamber of Deputies  :\
\'93I am of the party of revolution , not only in France , but in Europe  .  I wish the government of the revolution to remain in the hands of moderate men  .   .   .  but if that government should fall into the hand of ardent minds , even into those of radicals , I shall , for all that , not desert my cause  .  I shall always be of the party of the revolution  . \'94\
The February Revolution came  .  Instead of displacing the Guizot Cabinet by the Thiers Cabinet , as the little man had dreamt , it superseded Louis Philippe by the republic  .  On the first day of the popular victory , he carefully hid himself , forgetting that the contempt of the working men screened him from their hatred  .  Still , with his legendary courage , he continued to shy the public stage , until the June  [ 1848 ] massacres had cleared it for his sort of action  .  Then he became the leading mind of the \'93Party of Order\'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#F"}}{\fldrslt  [ F ]}}\'a0and its parliamentary republic , that anonymous interregnum , in which all the rival factions of the ruling class conspired together to crush the people , and conspired against each other to restore to each of them its own monarchy  .  Then , as now , Thiers denounced the republicans as the only obstacle to the consolidation of the republic ; then , as now , he spoke to the republic as the hangman spoke to Don Carlos  : \'93I shall assassinate thee , but for thy own good  . \'94 Now , as then , he will have to exclaim on the day after his victory  :\'a0L\'92Empire est fait\'a0\'96 the empire is consummated  . \
Despite his hypocritical homilies about the necessary liberties and his personal grudge against Louis Bonaparte , who had made a dupe of him , and kicked out parliamentarism \'96 and , outside of its factitious atmosphere , the little man is conscious of withering into nothingness \'96 he had a hand in all the infamies of the Second Empire , from the occupation of Rome by French troops to the war with Prussia , which he incited by his fierce invective against German unity \'96 not as a cloak of Prussian despotism , but as an encroachment upon the vested right of France in German disunion  .  Fond of brandishing , with his dwarfish arms in the face of Europe , the sword of the first Napoleon , whose historical shoeblack he had become , his foreign policy always culminated in the utter humiliation of France \'96 from the London convention{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#G"}}{\fldrslt  [ G ]}}\'a0of 1840 to the Paris capitulation of 1871 , and the present civil war , where he hounds on the prisoners of Sedan and Metz{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#H"}}{\fldrslt  [ H ]}}against Paris by special permission of Bismarck  . \
Despite his versatility of talent and shiftiness of purpose , this man has his whole lifetime been wedded to the most fossil routine  .  It is self-evident that to him the deeper undercurrents of modern society remained forever hidden ; but even the most palpable changes on its surface were abhorrent to a brain (  all the vitality of which  ) had fled to the tongue  .  Thus , he never tired of denouncing as a sacrilege any deviation from the old French protective system  . \
When a minister of Louis Philippe , he railed at railways as a wild chimera ; and when in opposition under Louis Bonaparte , he branded as a profanation every attempt to reform the rotten French army system  .  Never in his long political career has he been guilty of a single \'96 even the smallest \'96 measure of any practical use  .  Thiers was consistent only in his greed for wealth and his hatred of the men that produce it  .  Having entered his first ministry , under Louis Philippe , poor as Job , he left it a millionaire  .  His last ministry under the same king (  of March 1 , 1840  ) exposed him to public taunts of peculation in the Chamber of Deputies , to which he was content to reply by tears \'96 a commodity he deals in as freely as Jules Favre , or any other crocodile  .  At Bordeaux , his first measure for saving France from impending financial ruin was to endow himself with three millions a year , the first and the last word of the \'93Economical Republic ,\'94 the vista of which he had opened to his Paris electors in 1869  .  One of his former colleagues of the Chamber of Deputies of 1830 , himself a capitalist and , nevertheless , a devoted member of the Paris Commune , M  .  Beslay , lately addressed Thiers thus in a public placard  :\
\'93The enslavement of labor by capital has always been the cornerstone of your policy , and from the very day you saw the Republic of Labor installed at the Hotel de Ville , you have never ceased to cry out to France  : \'91These are criminals  !\'92\'94\
A master in small state roguery , a virtuoso in perjury and treason , a craftsman in all the petty strategems , cunning devices , and base perfidies of parliamentary warfare ; never scrupling , when out of office , to fan a revolution , and to stifle it in blood when at the helm of the state ; with class prejudices standing him in the place of ideas , and vanity in the place of a heart ; his private life as infamous as his public life is odious \'96 even now , when playing the part of a French Sulla , he cannot help setting off the abomination of his deeds by the ridicule of his ostentation  . \
The capitulation of Paris , by surrendering to Prussia not only Paris , but all France , closed the long-continued intrigues of treason with the enemy , which the usurpers of September 4 had begun , as Trochu himself said , on the very same day  .  On the other hand , it initiated the civil war they were now to wage , with the assistance of Prussia , against the republic and Paris  .  The trap was laid in the very terms of the capitulation  .  At that time , above one-third of the territory was in the hands of the enemy , the capital was cut off from the provinces , all communications were disorganized  .  To elect , under such circumstances , a real representation of France was impossible , unless ample time were given for preparation  .  In view of this , the capitulation stipulated that a National Assembly must be elected within eight days ; so that in many parts of France the news of the impending election arrived on its eve only  .  This assembly , moreover , was , by an express clause of the capitulation , to be elected for the sole purpose of deciding on peace or war , and , eventually , to conclude a treaty of peace  .  The population could not but feel that the terms of the armistice rendered the continuation of the war impossible , and that for sanctioning the peace imposed by Bismarck , the worst men in France were the best  .  But not content with these precautions , Thiers even before the secret of the armistice had been broached to Paris , set out for an electioneering tour through the provinces , there to galvanize back into life the Legitimist party , which now , along with the Orleanists , had to take the place of the then impossible Bonapartists  .  He was not afraid of them  .  Impossible as a government of modern France , and , therefore , contemptible as rivals , what party were more eligible as tools of counter-revolution than the party whose action , in the words of Thiers himself (  Chamber of Deputies , January 5 , 1833  ) , \'93Had always been confined to the three resources of foreign invasion , civil war , and anarchy\'94  ? They verily believed in the advent of their long-expected retrospective millennium  .  There were the heels of foreign invasion trampling upon France ; there was the downfall of an empire , and the captivity of Bonaparte ; and there they were themselves  .  The wheel of history had evidently rolled back to stop at the \'93Chambers introuvable\'94 of 1816  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#I"}}{\fldrslt  [ I ]}}\'a0In the assemblies of the republic , 1848 to 1851 , they had been represented by their educated and trained parliamentary champions ; it was the rank-and-file of the party which now rushed in \'96 all the Pourceaugnacs of France  . \'a0 [ a character in one of Moli\'e8re\'92s comedies , typifying the dull-witted , narrow-minded petty landed gentry  .  ]\
As soon as this Assembly of \'93Rurals  "  {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#J"}}{\fldrslt  [ J ]}}\'a0had met at Bordeaux , Thiers made it clear to them that the peace preliminaries must be assented to at once , without even the honors of a parliamentary debate , as the only conditions on which Prussia would permit them to open the war against the republic and Paris , its stronghold  .  The counter-revolution had , in fact , no time to lose  .  The Second Empire had more than doubled the national debt , and plunged all the large towns into heavy municipal debts  .  The war had fearfully swelled the liabilities , and mercilessly ravaged the resources of the nation  .  To complete the ruin , the Prussian Shylock was there with his bond for the keep of half a million of his soldiers on French soil , his indemnity for five milliards{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#K"}}{\fldrslt  [ K ]}} , and interest at 5 per cent on the unpaid instalments thereof  .  Who was to pay this bill  ? It was only by the violent overthrow of the republic that the appropriators of wealth could hope to shift onto the shoulders of its producers the cost of a war which they , the appropriators , had themselves originated  .  Thus , the immense ruin of France spurred on these patriotic representatives of land and capital , under the very eyes and patronage of the invader , to graft upon the foreign war a civil war \'96 a slaveholders\'92 rebellion  . \
There stood in the way of this conspiracy one great obstacle \'96 Paris  .  To disarm Paris was the first condition of success  .  Paris was therefore summoned by Thiers to surrender its arms  .  Then Paris was exasperated by the frantic anti-republican demonstrations of the \'93Rural\'94 Assembly and by Thiers\'92 own equivocations about the legal status of the republic ; by the threat to decapitate and decapitalize Paris ; the appointment of Orleanist ambassadors ; Dufaure\'92s laws on over-due commercial bills and house rents{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#L"}}{\fldrslt  [ L ]}} , inflicting ruin on the commerce and industry of Paris ; Pouyer-Quertier\'92s tax of two centimes upon every copy of every imaginable publication ; the sentences of death against Blanqui and Flourens ; the suppression of the republican journals ; the transfer of the National Assembly to Versailles ; the renewal of the state of siege declared by Palikao , and expired on September 4 ; the appointment of Vinoy , the\'a0D\'e9cembriseur{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#M"}}{\fldrslt  [ M ]}} , as governor of Paris \'96 of Valentin , the imperialist\'a0gendarme , as its prefect of police \'96 and of D\'92Aurelles de Paladine , the Jesuit general , as the commander-in-chief of its National Guard  . \
And now we have to address a question to M  .  Thiers and the men of national defence , his under-strappers  .  It is known that , through the agency of M  .  Pouyer-Quertier , his finance ministers , Thiers had contracted a loan of two milliards  .  Now , is it true or not \'96\
1  .  That the business was so managed that a consideration of several hundred millions was secured for the private benefit of Thiers , Jules Favre , Ernest Picard , Pouyer-Quertier , and Jules Simon  ? and \'96\
2  .  That no money was to be paid down until after the \'93pacification\'94 of Paris  ?{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#N"}}{\fldrslt  [ N ]}}\
At all events , there must have been something very pressing in the matter , for Thiers and Jules Favre , in the name of the majority of the Bordeaux Assembly , unblushingly solicited the immediate occupation of Paris by Prussian troops  .  Such , however , was not the game of Bismarck , as he sneeringly , and in public , told the admiring Frankfort philistines on his return to Germany  . \
\'a0\
Armed Paris was the only serious obstacle in the way of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy  .  Paris was , therefore , to be disarmed  . \
On this point , the Bordeaux Assembly  [ National Assembly ] was sincerity itself  .  If the roaring rant of its Rurals had not been audible enough , the surrender of Paris by Thiers to the tender mercies of the triumvirate of Vinoy the\'a0Decembriseur , Valentin the Bonapartist\'a0gendarme , and Aurelles de Paladine the Jesuit general , would have cut off even the last subterfuge of doubt  . \
But while insultingly exhibiting the true purpose of the disarmament of Paris , the conspirators asked her to lay down her arms on a pretext which was the most glaring , the most barefaced of lies  .  The artillery of the Paris National Guard , said Thiers , belonged to the state , and to the state it must be returned  .  The fact was this  : From the very day of the capitulation , by which Bismarck\'92s prisoners had signed the surrender of France , but reserved to themselves a numerous bodyguard for the express purpose of cowing Paris , Paris stood on the watch  .  The National Guard reorganized themselves and entrusted their supreme control to a Central Committee elected by their whole body , save some fragments of the old Bonapartist formations  .  On the eve of the entrance of the Prussians into Paris , the Central Committee took measures for the removal to Montmartre , Belleville , and La Villette , of the cannon and\'a0mitrailleuses\'a0treacherously abandoned by thecapitulards\'a0in and about the very quarters the Prussians were to occupy  .  That artillery had been furnished by the subscriptions of the National Guard  .  As their private property , it was officially recognized in the capitulation of January 28 , and on that very title exempted from the general surrender , into the hands of the conqueror , or arms belonging to the government  .  And Thiers was so utterly destitute of even the flimsiest pretext for initiating the war against Paris , that he had to resort to the flagrant lie of the artillery of the National Guard being state property  !\
The seizure of her artillery was evidently but to serve as the preliminary to the general disarmament of Paris , and , therefore , of the Revolution of September 4  .  But that revolution had become the legal status of France  .  The republic , its work , was recognized by the conqueror in the terms of the capitulation  .  After the capitulation , it was acknowledged by all foreign powers , and in its name , the National Assembly had been summoned  .  The Paris working men\'92s revolution of September 4 was the only legal title of the National Assembly seated at Bordeaux , and of its executive  .  Without it , the National Assembly would at once have to give way to the\'a0Corps Legislatif\'a0elected in 1869 by universal suffrage under French , not under Prussian , rule , and forcibly dispersed by the arm of the revolution  .  Thiers and his ticket-of-leave men would have had to capitulate for safe conducts signed by Louis Bonaparte , to save them from a voyage to Cayenne{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch04.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}  .  The National Assembly , with its power of attorney to settle the terms of peace with Prussia , was but an incident of that revolution , the true embodiment of which was still armed Paris , which had initiated it , undergone for it a five-months\'92 siege , with its horrors of famine , and made her prolonged resistance , despite Trochu\'92s plan , the basis of an obstinate war of defence in the provinces  .  And Paris was now either to lay down her arms at the insulting behest of the rebellious slaveholders of Bordeaux , and acknowledge that her Revolution of September 4 meant nothing but a simple transfer of power from Louis Bonaparte to his royal rivals ; or she had to stand forward as the self-sacrificing champion of France , whose salvation from ruin and whose regeneration were impossible without the revolutionary overthrow of the political and social conditions that had engendered the Second Empire , and under its fostering care , matured into utter rottenness  .  Paris , emaciated by a five-months\'92 famine , did not hesitate one moment  .  She heroically resolved to run all the hazards of a resistance against French conspirators , even with Prussian cannon frowning upon her from her own forts  .  Still , in its abhorrence of the civil war into which Paris was to be goaded , the Central Committee continued to persist in a merely defensive attitude , despite the provocations of the Assembly , the usurpations of the Executive , and the menacing concentration of troops in and around Paris  . \
Thiers opened the civil war by sending Vinoy , at the head of a multitude of\'a0sergents-de-ville , and some regiments of the line , upon a nocturnal expedition against Montmartre , there to seize , by surprise , the artillery of the National Guard  .  It is well known how this attempt broke down before the resistance of the National Guard and the fraternization of the line with the people  .  Aurelles de Paldine had printed beforehand his bulletin of victory , and Thiers held ready the placards announcing his measures of coup d\'92etat  .  Now these had to be replaced by Thiers\'92 appeals , imparting his magnanimous resolve to leave the National Guard in the possession of their arms , with which , he said , he felt sure they would rally round the government against the rebels  .  Out of 300 ,000 National guards , only 300 responded to this summons to rally around little Thiers against themselves  .  The glorious working men\'92s Revolution of March 18 took undisputed sway of Paris  .  The Central Committee was its provisional government  .  Europe seemed , for a moment , to doubt whether its recent sensational performances of state and war had any reality in them , or whether they were the dreams of a long bygone past  . \
From March 18 to the entrance of the Versailles troops into Paris , the proletarian revolution remained so free from the acts of violence in which the revolutions \'96 and still more the counter-revolutions \'96 of the \'93better classes\'94 abound , that no facts were left to its opponents to cry out about , but the executions of Generals Lecomte and Clement Thomas , and the affair of the Place Vendome  . \
One of the Bonapartist officers engaged in the nocturnal attempt against Montmartre , General Lecomte , had four times ordered the 81st line regiment to fire at an unarmed gathering in the Place Pigalle , and on their refusal fiercely insulted them  .  Instead of shooting women and children , his own men shot him  .  The inveterate habits acquired by the soldiery under the training of the enemies of the working class are , of course , not likely to change the very moment these soldiers change sides  .  The same men executed Clement Thomas  . \
\'93General\'94 Clement Thomas , a malcontent ex-quartermaster-sergeant , had , in the latter times of Louis Philippe\'92s reign , enlisted at the office of the republican newspaper\'a0Le National , there to serve in the double capacity of responsible man-of-straw (  gerant responsable  ) and of duelling bully to that very combative journal  .  After the February Revolution , the men of the\'a0National\'a0having got into power , they metamorphosed this old quarter-master-sergeant into a general on the eve of the butchery of June \'96 of which he , like Jules Favre , was one of the sinister plotters , and became one of the most dastardly executioners  .  Then he and his generalship disappeared for a long time , to again rise to the surface on November 1 , 1870  .  The day before , the Government of National Defence , caught at the Hotel de Ville , had solemnly pledged their parole to Blanqui , Flourens , and other representatives of the working class , to abdicate their usurped power into the hands of a commune to be freely elected by Paris  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch04.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\'a0Instead of keeping their word , they let loose on Paris the Bretons of Trochu , who now replaced the Corsicans of Bonaparte  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch04.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}\'a0General Tamisier alone , refusing to sully his name by such a breach of faith , resigned the commandership-in-chief of the National Guard , and in his place Clement Thomas for once became again a general  .  During the whole of his tenure of command , he made war , not upon the Prussians , but upon the Paris National Guard  .  He prevented their general armament , pitted the bourgeois battalions against the working men\'92s battalions , weeded out officers hostile to Trochu\'92s \'93plan ,\'94 and disbanded , under the stigma of cowardice , the very same proletarian battalions whose heroism has now astonished their most inveterate enemies  .  Clement Thomas felt quite proud of having reconquered his June pre-eminence as the personal enemy of the working class of Paris  .  Only a few days before March 18 , he laid before the War Minister , Leflo , a plan of his own for \'93finishing off\'a0la fine fleur\'a0 [ the cream ] of the Paris canaille  . \'94 After Vinoy\'92s rout , he must needs appear upon the scene of action in the quality of an amateur spy  .  The Central Committee and the Paris working men were as much responsible for the killing of Clement Thomas and Lecomte as the Princess of Wales for the fate of the people crushed to death on the day of her entrance into London  . \
The massacre of unarmed citizens in Place Vendome is a myth which M  .  Thiers and the Rurals persistently ignored in the Assembly , entrusting its propagation exclusively to the servants\'92 hall of European journalism  .  \'93The men of order ,\'94 the reactionists of Paris , trembled at the victory of March 18  .  To them , it was the signal of popular retribution at last arriving  .  The ghosts of the victims assassinated at their hands from the days of June 1848 , down to January 22 , 1871 ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch04.htm#D"}}{\fldrslt  [ D ]}}\'a0arose before their faces  .  Their panic was their only punishment  .  Even the\'a0sergents-de-ville , instead of being disarmed and locked up , as ought to have been done , had the gates of Paris flung open wide for their safe retreat to Versailles  .  The men of order were left not only unharmed , but allowed to rally and quietly seize more than one stronghold in the very centre of Paris  .  This indulgence of the Central Committee \'96 this magnanimity of the armed working men \'96 so strangely at variance with the habits of the \'93Party of Order ,\'94 the latter misinterpreted as mere symptoms of conscious weakness  .  Hence their silly plan to try , under the cloak of an unarmed demonstration , what Vinoy had failed to perform with his cannon and\'a0mitrailleuses  .  On March 22 , a riotous mob of swells started from the quarters of luxury , all the\'a0petits creves\'a0in their ranks , and at their head the notorious familiars of the empire \'96 the Heeckeren , Coetlogon , Henri de Pene , etc  .  Under the cowardly pretence of a pacific demonstration , this rabble , secretly armed with the weapons of the bravo\'a0 [ i  . e  .  hired assassin ] , fell into marching order , ill-treated and disarmed the detached patrols and sentries of the National Guard they met with on their progress , and , on debouching from the Rue de la Paix , with the cry of \'93Down with the Central Committee  ! Down with the assassins  ! The National Assembly forever  !\'94 attempted to break through the line drawn up there , and thus to carry by surprise the headquarters of the National Guard in the Place Vendome  .  In reply to their pistol-shots , the regular\'a0sommations\'a0(  the French equivalent of the English Riot Act  ){\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch04.htm#E"}}{\fldrslt  [ E ]}}\'a0were made , and , proving ineffective , fire was commanded by the general  [ Bergeret ] of the National Guard  .  One volley dispersed into wild flight the silly coxcombs , who expected that the mere exhibition of their \'93respectability\'94 would have the same effect upon the Revolution of Paris as Joshua\'92s trumpets upon the walls of Jericho  .  The runaways left behind them two National Guards killed , nine severely wounded (  among them a member of the Central Committee  [ Maljournal ]  ) , and the whole scene of their exploit strewn with revolvers , daggers , and sword-canes , in evidence of the \'93unarmed\'94 character of their \'93pacific\'94 demonstration  .  When , on June 13 , 1849 , the National Guard made a really pacific demonstration in protest against the felonious assault of French troops upon Rome , Changarnier , then general of the Party of Order , was acclaimed by the National Assembly , and especially by M  .  Thiers , as the savior of society , for having launched his troops from all sides upon these unarmed men , to shoot and sabre them down , and to trample them under their horses\'92 feet  .  Paris , then was placed under a state of siege  .  Dufaure hurried through the Assembly new laws of repression  .  New arrests , new proscriptions \'96 a new reign of terror set in  .  But the lower orders manage these things otherwise  .  The Central Committee of 1871 simply ignored the heroes of the \'93pacific demonstration  "   ; so much so , that only two days later , they were enabled to muster under Admiral Saisset , for that\'a0armed\'a0demonstration , crowned by the famous stampede to Versailles  .  In their reluctance to continue the civil war opened by Thiers\'92 burglarious attempt on Montmartre , the Central Committee made themselves , this time , guilty of a decisive mistake in not at once marching upon Versailles , then completely helpless , and thus putting an end to the conspiracies of Thiers and his Rurals  .  Instead of this , the Party of Order was again allowed to try its strength at the ballot box , on March 26 , the day of the election of the Commune  .  Then , in the\'a0mairies\'a0of Paris , they exchanged bland words of conciliation with their too generous conquerors , muttering in their hearts solemn vows to exterminate them in due time  . \
Now , look at the reverse of the medal  .  Thiers opened his second campaign against Paris in the beginning of April  .  The first batch of Parisian prisoners brought into Versailles was subjected to revolting atrocities , while Ernest Picard , with his hands in his trousers\'92 pockets , strolled about jeering them , and while Mesdames Thiers and Favre , in the midst of their ladies of honor (    ?  ) applauded , from the balcony , the outrages of the Versailles mob  .  The captured soldiers of the line were massacred in cold blood ; our brave friend , General Duval , the iron-founder , was shot without any form of trial  .  Galifet , the kept man of his wife , so notorious for her shameless exhibitions at the orgies of the Second Empire , boasted in a proclamation of having commanded the murder of a small troop of National Guards , with their captain and lieutenant , surprised and disarmed by his Chasseurs  .  Vinoy , the runaway , was appointed by Thiers , Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor , for his general order to shoot down every soldier of the line taken in the ranks of the Federals  .  Desmaret , the Gendarme , was decorated for the treacherous butcher-like chopping in pieces of the high-souled and chivalrous Flourens , who had saved the heads of the Government of Defence on October 31 , 1870  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch04.htm#F"}}{\fldrslt  [ F ]}}\'a0\'93The encouraging particulars\'94 of his assassination were triumphantly expatiated upon by Thiers in the National Assembly  .  With the elated vanity of a parliamentary Tom Thumb permitted to play the part of a Tamerlane , he denied the rebels the right of neutrality for ambulances  .  Nothing more horrid than that monkey allowed for a time to give full fling to his tigerish instincts , as foreseen by Voltaire  .  [ Candide , Ch  .  22 ](  See\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/news.htm"}}{\fldrslt news articles}}  )\
After the decree of the Commune of April 7 , ordering reprisals and declaring it to be the duty \'93to protect Paris against the cannibal exploits of the Versailles banditti , and to demand an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth ,\'94\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch04.htm#G"}}{\fldrslt  [ G ]}}\'a0Thiers did not stop the barbarous treatment of prisoners , moreover , insulting them in his bulletins as follows  : \'93Never have more degraded countenances of a degraded democracy met the afflicted gazes of honest men\'94 \'96 honest , like Thiers himself and his ministerial ticket-of-leave men  .  Still , the shooting of prisoners was suspended for a time  .  Hardly , however , had Thiers and his Decembrist generals\'a0 [ of the December 2 , 1851 coup by Louis Bonaparte ]\'a0become aware that the Communal decree of reprisals was but an empty threat , that even their gendarme spies caught in Paris under the disguise of National Guards , that even\'a0sergents-de-ville , taken with incendiary shells upon them , were spared \'96 when the wholesale shooting of prisoners was resumed and carried on uninterruptedly to the end  .  Houses to which National Guards had fled were surrounded by gendarmes , inundated with petroleum (  which here occurs for the first time in this war  ) , and then set fire to , the charred corpses being afterwards brought out by the ambulance of the Press at the Ternes  .  Four National Guards having surrendered to a troop of mounted Chasseurs at Belle Epine , on April 25 , were afterwards shot down , one after another , by the captain , a worthy man of Gallifet\'92s  .  One of his four victims , left for dead , Scheffer , crawled back to the Parisian outposts , and deposed to this fact before a commission of the Commune  .  When Tolain interpellated the War Minister upon the report of this commission , the Rurals drowned his voice and forbade Leflo to answer  .  It would be an insult to their \'93glorious\'94 army to speak of its deeds  .  The flippant tone in which Thiers\'92 bulletin announced the bayoneting of the Federals , surprised asleep at Moulin Saquet , and the wholesale fusillades at Clamart shocked the nerves even of the not over-sensitive London\'a0Times  .  But it would be ludicrous today to attempt recounting the merely preliminary atrocities committed by the bombarders of Paris and the fomenters of a slaveholders\'92 rebellion protected by foreign invasion  .  Amidst all these horrors , Thiers , forgetful of his parliamentary laments on the terrible responsibility weighing down his dwarfish shoulders , boasts in his bulletins that\'a0l\'92Assemblee siege paisiblement\'a0(  the Assembly continues meeting in peace  ) , and proves by his constant carousals , now with Decembrist generals , now with German princes , that his digestion is not troubled in the least , not even by the ghosts of Lecomte and Clement Thomas  . \
On the dawn of March 18 , Paris arose to the thunder-burst of \'93Vive la Commune  !\'94 What is the Commune , that sphinx so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind  ?\
\'93The proletarians of Paris ,\'94 said the Central Committee in its manifesto of March 18 , \'93amidst the failures and treasons of the ruling classes , have understood that the hour has struck for them to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of public affairs  .   .   .   .  They have understood that it is their imperious duty , and their absolute right , to render themselves masters of their own destinies , by seizing upon the governmental power  . \'94\
But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery , and wield it for its own purposes  . \
The centralized state power , with its ubiquitous organs of standing army , police , bureaucracy , clergy , and judicature \'96 organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labor \'96 originates from the days of absolute monarchy , serving nascent middle class society as a mighty weapon in its struggle against feudalism  .  Still , its development remained clogged by all manner of medieval rubbish , seignorial rights , local privileges , municipal and guild monopolies , and provincial constitutions  .  The gigantic broom of the French Revolution of the 18th century swept away all these relics of bygone times , thus clearing simultaneously the social soil of its last hinderances to the superstructure of the modern state edifice raised under the First Empire , itself the offspring of the coalition wars of old semi-feudal Europe against modern France  . \
During the subsequent regimes , the government , placed under parliamentary control \'96 that is , under the direct control of the propertied classes \'96 became not only a hotbed of huge national debts and crushing taxes ; with its irresistible allurements of place , pelf , and patronage , it became not only the bone of contention between the rival factions and adventurers of the ruling classes ; but its political character changed simultaneously with the economic changes of society  .  At the same pace at which the progress of modern industry developed , widened , intensified the class antagonism between capital and labor , the state power assumed more and more the character of the national power of capital over labor , of a public force organized for social enslavement , of an engine of class despotism  . \
After every revolution marking a progressive phase in the class struggle , the purely repressive character of the state power stands out in bolder and bolder relief  .  The Revolution of 1830 , resulting in the transfer of government from the landlords to the capitalists , transferred it from the more remote to the more direct antagonists of the working men  .  The bourgeois republicans , who , in the name of the February Revolution , took the state power , used it for the June  [ 1848 ] massacres , in order to convince the working class that \'93social\'94 republic means the republic entrusting their social subjection , and in order to convince the royalist bulk of the bourgeois and landlord class that they might safely leave the cares and emoluments of government to the bourgeois \'93republicans  . \'94\
However , after their one heroic exploit of June , the bourgeois republicans had , from the front , to fall back to the rear of the \'93Party of Order\'94 \'96 a combination formed by all the rival fractions and factions of the appropriating classes  .  The proper form of their joint-stock government was the parliamentary republic , with Louis Bonaparte for its president  .  Theirs was a regime of avowed class terrorism and deliberate insult towards the \'93vile multitude  . \'94\
If the parliamentary republic , as M  .  Thiers said , \'93divided them  [ the different fractions of the ruling class ] least  "   , it opened an abyss between that class and the whole body of society outside their spare ranks  .  The restraints by which their own divisions had under former regimes still checked the state power , were removed by their union ; and in view of the threatening upheaval of the proletariat , they now used that state power mercilessly and ostentatiously as the national war engine of capital against labor  . \
In their uninterrupted crusade against the producing masses , they were , however , bound not only to invest the executive with continually increased powers of repression , but at the same time to divest their own parliamentary stronghold \'96 the National Assembly \'96 one by one , of all its own means of defence against the Executive  .  The Executive , in the person of Louis Bonaparte , turned them out  .  The natural offspring of the \'93Party of Order\'94 republic was the Second Empire  . \
The empire , with the coup d\'92etat for its birth certificate , universal suffrage for its sanction , and the sword for its sceptre , professed to rest upon the peasantry , the large mass of producers not directly involved in the struggle of capital and labor  .  It professed to save the working class by breaking down parliamentarism , and , with it , the undisguised subserviency of government to the propertied classes  .  It professed to save the propertied classes by upholding their economic supremacy over the working class ; and , finally , it professed to unite all classes by reviving for all the chimera of national glory  . \
In reality , it was the only form of government possible at a time when the bourgeoisie had already lost , and the working class had not yet acquired , the faculty of ruling the nation  .  It was acclaimed throughout the world as the savior of society  .  Under its sway , bourgeois society , freed from political cares , attained a development unexpected even by itself  .  Its industry and commerce expanded to colossal dimensions ; financial swindling celebrated cosmopolitan orgies ; the misery of the masses was set off by a shameless display of gorgeous , meretricious and debased luxury  .  The state power , apparently soaring high above society and the very hotbed of all its corruptions  .  Its own rottenness , and the rottenness of the society it had saved , were laid bare by the bayonet of Prussia , herself eagerly bent upon transferring the supreme seat of that regime from Paris to Berlin  .  Imperialism is , at the same time , the most prostitute and the ultimate form of the state power which nascent middle class society had commenced to elaborate as a means of its own emancipation from feudalism , and which full-grown bourgeois society had finally transformed into a means for the enslavement of labor by capital  . \
The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune  .  The cry of \'93social republic ,\'94 with which the February Revolution was ushered in by the Paris proletariat , did but express a vague aspiration after a republic that was not only to supercede the monarchical form of class rule , but class rule itself  .  The Commune was the positive form of that republic  . \
Paris , the central seat of the old governmental power , and , at the same time , the social stronghold of the French working class , had risen in arms against the attempt of Thiers and the Rurals to restore and perpetuate that old governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire  .  Paris could resist only because , in consequence of the siege , it had got rid of the army , and replaced it by a National Guard , the bulk of which consisted of working men  .  This fact was now to be transformed into an institution  .  The first decree of the Commune , therefore , was the suppression of the standing army , and the substitution for it of the armed people  . \
The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors , chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town , responsible and revocable at short terms  .  The majority of its members were naturally working men , or acknowledged representatives of the working class  .  The Commune was to be a working , not a parliamentary body , executive and legislative at the same time  . \
Instead of continuing to be the agent of the Central Government , the police was at once stripped of its political attributes , and turned into the responsible , and at all times revocable , agent of the Commune  .  So were the officials of all other branches of the administration  .  From the members of the Commune downwards , the public service had to be done at\'a0workman\'92s wage  .  The vested interests and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves  .  Public functions ceased to be the private property of the tools of the Central Government  .  Not only municipal administration , but the whole initiative hitherto exercised by the state was laid into the hands of the Commune  . \
Having once got rid of the standing army and the police \'96 the physical force elements of the old government \'96 the Commune was anxious to break the spiritual force of repression , the \'93parson-power  "   , by the disestablishment and disendowment of all churches as proprietary bodies  .  The priests were sent back to the recesses of private life , there to feed upon the alms of the faithful in imitation of their predecessors , the apostles  . \
The whole of the educational institutions were opened to the people gratuitously , and at the same time cleared of all interference of church and state  .  Thus , not only was education made accessible to all , but science itself freed from the fetters which class prejudice and governmental force had imposed upon it  . \
The judicial functionaries were to be divested of that sham\'a0independence which had but served to mask their abject subserviency to all succeeding governments to which , in turn , they had taken , and broken , the oaths of allegiance  .  Like the rest of public servants , magistrates and judges were to be elective , responsible , and revocable  . \
The Paris Commune was , of course , to serve as a model to all the great industrial centres of France  .  The communal regime once established in Paris and the secondary centres , the old centralized government would in the provinces , too , have to give way to the self-government of the producers  . \
In a rough sketch of national organization , which the Commune had no time to develop , it states clearly that the Commune was to be the political form of even the smallest country hamlet , and that in the rural districts the standing army was to be replaced by a national militia , with an extremely short term of service  .  The rural communities of every district were to administer their common affairs by an assembly of delegates in the central town , and these district assemblies were again to send deputies to the National Delegation in Paris , each delegate to be at any time revocable and bound by the\'a0mandat imperatif\'a0(  formal instructions  ) of his constituents  .  The few but important functions which would still remain for a central government were not to be suppressed , as has been intentionally misstated , but were to be discharged by Communal and thereafter responsible agents  . \
The unity of the nation was not to be broken , but , on the contrary , to be organized by Communal Constitution , and to become a reality by the destruction of the state power which claimed to be the embodiment of that unity independent of , and superior to , the nation itself , from which it was but a parasitic excresence  . \
While the merely repressive organs of the old governmental power were to be amputated , its legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority usurping pre-eminence over society itself , and restored to the responsible agents of society  . \'a0Instead of deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people in Parliament , universal suffrage was to serve the people , constituted in Communes , as individual suffrage serves every other employer in the search for the workmen and managers in his business  .  And it is well-known that companies , like individuals , in matters of real business generally know how to put the right man in the right place , and , if they for once make a mistake , to redress it promptly  .  On the other hand , nothing could be more foreign to the spirit of the Commune than to supercede universal suffrage by hierarchical investiture  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\
It is generally the fate of completely new historical creations to be mistaken for the counterparts of older , and even defunct , forms of social life , to which they may bear a certain likeness  .  Thus , this new Commune , which breaks with the modern state power , has been mistaken for a reproduction of the medieval Communes , which first preceded , and afterward became the substratum of , that very state power  .  The Communal Constitution has been mistaken for an attempt to break up into the federation of small states , as dreamt of by Montesquieu and the Girondins ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\'a0that unity of great nations which , if originally brought about by political force , has now become a powerful coefficient of social production  .  The antagonism of the Commune against the state power has been mistaken for an exaggerated form of the ancient struggle against over-centralization  .  Peculiar historical circumstances may have prevented the classical development , as in France , of the bourgeois form of government , and may have allowed , as in England , to complete the great central state organs by corrupt vestries , jobbing councillors , and ferocious poor-law guardians in the towns , and virtually hereditary magistrates in the counties  . \
The Communal Constitution would have restored to the social body all the forces hitherto absorbed by the state parasite feeding upon , and clogging the free movement of , society  .  By this one act , it would have initiated the regeneration of France  . \
The provincial French middle class saw in the Commune an attempt to restore the sway their order had held over the country under Louis Philippe , and which , under Louis Napoleon , was supplanted by the pretended rule of the country over the towns  .  In reality , the Communal Constitution brought the rural producers under the intellectual lead of the central towns of their districts , and there secured to them , in the working men , the natural trustees of their interests  .  The very existence of the Commune involved , as a matter of course , local municipal liberty , but no longer as a check upon the now superseded state power  .  It could only enter into the head of a Bismarck \'96 who , when not engaged on his intrigues of blood and iron , always likes to resume his old trade , so befitting his mental calibre , of contributor to\'a0Kladderadatsch\'a0(  the Berlin\'a0Punch  ){\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}\'a0\'96 it could only enter into such a head to ascribe to the Paris Commune aspirations after the caricature of the old French municipal organization of 1791 , the Prussian municipal constitution which degrades the town governments to mere secondary wheels in the police machinery of the Prussian state  .  The Commune made that catchword of bourgeois revolutions \'96 cheap government \'96 a reality by destroying the two greatest sources of expenditure  : the standing army and state functionarism  .  Its very existence presupposed the non-existence of monarchy , which , in Europe at least , is the normal incumbrance and indispensable cloak of class rule  .  It supplied the republic with the basis of really democratic institutions  .  But neither cheap government nor the \'93true republic\'94 was its ultimate aim ; they were its mere concomitants  . \
The multiplicity of interpretations to which the Commune has been subjected , and the multiplicity of interests which construed it in their favor , show that it was a thoroughly expansive political form , while all the previous forms of government had been emphatically repressive  .  Its true secret was this  :\
It was essentially a working class government , the product of the struggle of the producing against the appropriating class , the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor  . \
Except on this last condition , the Communal Constitution would have been an impossibility and a delusion  .  The political rule of the producer cannot co-exist with the perpetuation of his social slavery  .  The Commune was therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical foundation upon which rests the existence of classes , and therefore of class rule  .  With labor emancipated , every man becomes a working man , and productive labor ceases to be a class attribute  . \
It is a strange fact  .  In spite of all the tall talk and all the immense literature , for the last 60 years , about emancipation of labor , no sooner do the working men anywhere take the subject into their own hands with a will , than uprises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of present society with its two poles of capital and wages-slavery (  the landlord now is but the sleeping partner of the capitalist  ) , as if the capitalist society was still in its purest state of virgin innocence , with its antagonisms still undeveloped , with its delusions still unexploded , with its prostitute realities not yet laid bare  .  The Commune , they exclaim , intends to abolish property , the basis of all civilization  !\
Yes , gentlemen , the Commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labor of the many the wealth of the few  .  It aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators  .  It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production , land , and capital , now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor , into mere instruments of free and associated labor  .  But this is communism , \'93impossible\'94 communism  ! Why , those members of the ruling classes who are intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present system \'96 and they are many \'96 have become the obtrusive and full-mouthed apostles of co-operative production  .  If co-operative production is not to remain a sham and a snare ; if it is to supersede the capitalist system ; if united co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon common plan , thus taking it under their own control , and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist production \'96 what else , gentlemen , would it be but communism , \'93possible\'94 communism  ?\
The working class did not expect miracles from the Commune  .  They have no ready-made utopias to introduce\'a0par d\'e9cret du peuple  .  They know that in order to work out their own emancipation , and along with it that higher form to which present society is irresistably tending by its own economical agencies , they will have to pass through long struggles , through a series of historic processes , transforming circumstances and men  .  They have no ideals to realize , but to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant  .  In the full consciousness of their historic mission , and with the heroic resolve to act up to it , the working class can afford to smile at the coarse invective of the gentlemen\'92s gentlemen with pen and inkhorn , and at the didactic patronage of well-wishing bourgeois-doctrinaires , pouring forth their ignorant platitudes and sectarian crotchets in the oracular tone of scientific infallibility  . \
When the Paris Commune took the management of the revolution in its own hands ; when plain working men for the first time dared to infringe upon the governmental privilege of their \'93natural superiors ,\'94 and , under circumstances of unexampled difficulty , performed it at salaries the highest of which barely amounted to one-fifth of what , according to high scientific authority ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt (  1  )}}\'a0is the minimum required for a secretary to a certain metropolitan school-board \'96 the old world writhed in convulsions of rage at the sight of the Red Flag , the symbol of the Republic of Labor , floating over the H\'f4tel de Ville  . \
And yet , this was the first revolution in which the working class was openly acknowledged as the only class capable of social initiative , even by the great bulk of the Paris middle class \'96 shopkeepers , tradesmen , merchants \'96 the wealthy capitalist alone excepted  .  The Commune had saved them by a sagacious settlement of that ever recurring cause of dispute among the middle class themselves \'96 the debtor and creditor accounts  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#D"}}{\fldrslt  [ D ]}}\'a0The same portion of the middle class , after they had assisted in putting down the working men\'92s insurrection of June 1848 , had been at once unceremoniously sacrificed to their creditors{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#E"}}{\fldrslt  [ E ]}}\'a0by the then Constituent Assembly  .  But this was not their only motive for now rallying around the working class  .  They felt there was but one alternative \'96 the Commune , or the empire \'96 under whatever name it might reappear  .  The empire had ruined them economically by the havoc it made of public wealth , by the wholesale financial swindling it fostered , by the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralization of capital , and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks  .  It had suppressed them politically , it had shocked them morally by its orgies , it had insulted their Voltairianism by handing over the education of their children to the\'a0fr\'e9res Ignorantins ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#F"}}{\fldrslt  [ F ]}}\'a0it had revolted their national feeling as Frenchmen by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one equivalent for the ruins it made \'96 the disappearance of the empire  .  In fact , after the exodus from Paris of the high Bonapartist and capitalist\'a0boh\'e8me , the true middle class Party of Order came out in the shape of the \'93Union Republicaine ,\'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#G"}}{\fldrslt  [ G ]}}\'a0enrolling themselves under the colors of the Commune and defending it against the wilful misconstructions of Thiers  .  Whether the gratitude of this great body of the middle class will stand the present severe trial , time must show  . \
The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that \'93its victory was their only hope  . \'94 Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and re-echoed by the glorious European penny-a-liner , one of the most tremendous was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry  .  Think only of the love of the French peasant for the men to whom , after 1815 , he had to pay the milliard indemnity  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#H"}}{\fldrslt  [ H ]}}\'a0In the eyes of the French peasant , the very existence of a great landed proprietor is in itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789  .  The bourgeois , in 1848 , had burdened his plot of land with the additional tax of 45 cents in the franc ; but then he did so in the name of the revolution ; while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution , to shift on to the peasant\'92s shoulders the chief load of the 5 milliards of indemnity to be paid to the Prussian  .  The Commune , on the other hand , in one of its first proclamations , declared that the true originators of the war would be made to pay its cost  .  The Commune would have delivered the peasant of the blood tax \'96 would have given him a cheap government \'96 transformed his present blood-suckers , the notary , advocate , executor , and other judicial vampires , into salaried communal agents , elected by , and responsible to , himself  .  It would have freed him of the tyranny of the\'a0garde champ\'eatre , the gendarme , and the prefect ; would have put enlightenment by the schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest  .  And the French peasant is , above all , a man of reckoning  .  He would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest , instead of being extorted by the tax-gatherer , should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the parishioners\'92 religious instinct  .  Such were the great immediate boons which the rule of the Commune \'96 and that rule alone \'96 held out to the French peasantry  .  It is , therefore , quite superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital problems which the Commune alone was able , and at the same time compelled , to solve in favor of the peasant \'96 viz  .  , the hypothecary debt , lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil , the\'a0prol\'e9tariat foncier\'a0(  the rural proletariat  ) , daily growing upon it , and his expropriation from it enforced , at a more and more rapid rate , by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of capitalist farming  . \
The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the Republic ; but the Party of Order created the empire  .  What the French peasant really wants he commenced to show in 1849 and 1850 , by opposing his\'a0maire\'a0to the government\'92s prefect , his school-master to the government\'92s priest , and himself to the government\'92s gendarme  .  All the laws made by the Party of Order in January and February 1850 were avowed measures of repression against the peasant  .  The peasant was a Bonapartist , because the Great Revolution , with all its benefits to him , was , in his eyes , personified in Napoleon  .  This delusion , rapidly breaking down under the Second Empire (  and in its very nature hostile to the Rurals  ) , this prejudice of the past , how could it have withstood the appeal of the Commune to the living interests and urgent wants of the peasantry  ?\
The Rurals \'96 this was , in fact , their chief apprehension \'96 knew that three months\'92 free communication of Communal Paris with the provinces would bring about a general rising of the peasants , and hence their anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris , so as to stop the spread of the rinderpest\'a0 [ cattle pest \'96 contagious disease ]  . \
If the Commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy elements of French society , and therefore the truly national government , it was , at the same time , as a working men\'92s government , as the bold champion of the emancipation of labor , emphatically international  .  Within sight of that Prussian army , that had annexed to Germany two French provinces , the Commune annexed to France the working people all over the world  . \
The Second Empire had been the jubilee of cosmopolitan blackleggism , the rakes of all countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies and in the plunder of the French people  .  Even at this moment , the right hand of Thiers is Ganessco , the foul Wallachian , and his left hand is Markovsky , the Russian spy  .  The Commune admitted all foreigners to the honor of dying for an immortal cause  .  Between the foreign war lost by their treason , and the civil war fomented by their conspiracy with the foreign invader , the bourgeoisie had found the time to display their patriotism by organizing police hunts upon the Germans in France  .  The Commune made a German working man  [ Leo Frankel ] its Minister of Labor  .  Thiers , the bourgeoisie , the Second Empire , had continually deluded Poland by loud professions of sympathy , while in reality betraying her to , and doing the dirty work of , Russia  .  The Commune honored the heroic sons of Poland  [ J  .  Dabrowski and W  .  Wr\'f3blewski ] by placing them at the head of the defenders of Paris  .  And , to broadly mark the new era of history it was conscious of initiating , under the eyes of the conquering Prussians on one side , and the Bonapartist army , led by Bonapartist generals , on the other , the Commune pulled down that colossal symbol of martial glory , the Vend\'f4me Column  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#I"}}{\fldrslt  [ I ]}}\
The great social measure of the Commune was its own working existence  .  Its special measures could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people  .  Such were the abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers ; the prohibition , under penalty , of the employers\'92 practice to reduce wages by levying upon their workpeople fines under manifold pretexts \'96 a process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of legislator , judge , and executor , and filches the money to boot  .  Another measure of this class was the surrender to associations of workmen , under reserve of compensation , of all closed workshops and factories , no matter whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to strike work  . \
The financial measures of the Commune , remarkable for their sagacity and moderation , could only be such as were compatible with the state of a besieged town  .  Considering the colossal robberies committed upon the city of Paris by the great financial companies and contractors , under the protection of Haussman ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#J"}}{\fldrslt  [ J ]}}\'a0the Commune would have had an incomparably better title to confiscate their property than Louis Napoleon had against the Orleans family  .  The Hohenzollern and the English oligarchs , who both have derived a good deal of their estates from church plunders , were , of course , greatly shocked at the Commune clearing but 8 ,000F out of secularization  . \
While the Versailles government , as soon as it had recovered some spirit and strength , used the most violent means against the Commune ; while it put down the free expression of opinion all over France , even to the forbidding of meetings of delegates from the large towns ; while it subjected Versailles and the rest of France to an espionage far surpassing that of the Second Empire ; while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all papers printed at Paris , and sifted all correspondence from and to Paris ; while in the National Assembly the most timid attempts to put in a word for Paris were howled down in a manner unknown even to the\'a0Chambre introuvable\'a0of 1816 ; with the savage warfare of Versailles outside , and its attempts at corruption and conspiracy inside Paris \'96 would the Commune not have shamefully betrayed its trust by affecting to keep all the decencies and appearances of liberalism as in a time of profound peace  ? Had the government of the Commune been akin to that of M  .  Thiers , there would have been no more occasion to suppress Party of Order papers at Paris that there was to suppress Communal papers at Versailles  . \
It was irritating indeed to the Rurals that at the very same time they declared the return to the church to be the only means of salvation for France , the infidel Commune unearthed the peculiar mysteries of the Picpus nunnery , and of the Church of St  .  Laurent  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#K"}}{\fldrslt  [ K ]}}\'a0It was a satire upon M  .  Thiers that , while he showered grand crosses upon the Bonapartist generals in acknowledgment of their mastery in losing battles , signing capitulations , and turning cigarettes at Wilhelmsh\'f6he ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#L"}}{\fldrslt  [ L ]}}\'a0the Commune dismissed and arrested its generals whenever they were suspected of neglecting their duties  .  The expulsion from , and arrest by , the Commune of one of its members  [ Blanchet ] who had slipped in under a false name , and had undergone at Lyons six days\'92 imprisonment for simple bankruptcy , was it not a deliberate insult hurled at the forger , Jules Favre , then still the foreign minister of France , still selling France to Bismarck , and still dictating his orders to that paragon government of Belgium  ? But indeed the Commune did not pretend to infallibility , the invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp  .  It published its doings and sayings , it initiated the public into all its shortcomings  . \
In every revolution there intrude , at the side of its true agents , men of different stamp ; some of them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions , without insight into the present movement , but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage , or by the sheer force of tradition ; others mere brawlers who , by dint of repeating year after year the same set of stereotyped declarations against the government of the day , have sneaked into the reputation of revolutionists of the first water  .  After March 18 , some such men did also turn up , and in some cases contrived to play pre-eminent parts  .  As far as their power went , they hampered the real action of the working class , exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full development of every previous revolution  .  They are an unavoidable evil  : with time they are shaken off ; but time was not allowed to the Commune  . \
Wonderful , indeed , was the change the Commune had wrought in Paris  ! No longer any trace of the meretricious Paris of the Second Empire  ! No longer was Paris the rendezvous of British landlords , Irish absentees ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#M"}}{\fldrslt  [ M ]}}\'a0American ex-slaveholders and shoddy men , Russian ex-serfowners , and Wallachian boyards  .  No more corpses at the morgue , no nocturnal burglaries , scarcely any robberies ; in fact , for the first time since the days of February 1848 , the streets of Paris were safe , and that without any police of any kind  . \
\'93We ,\'94 said a member of the Commune , \'93hear no longer of assassination , theft , and personal assault ; it seems indeed as if the police had dragged along with it to Versailles all its Conservative friends  . \'94\
The\'a0cocottes\'a0 [ \'91chickens\'92 \'96 prostitutes ]\'a0had refound the scent of their protectors \'96 the absconding men of family , religion , and , above all , of property  .  In their stead , the real women of Paris showed again at the surface \'96 heroic , noble , and devoted , like the women of antiquity  .  Working , thinking fighting , bleeding Paris \'96 almost forgetful , in its incubation of a new society , of the Cannibals at its gates \'96 radiant in the enthusiasm of its historic initiative  !\
Opposed to this new world at Paris , behold the old world at Versailles \'96 that assembly of the ghouls of all defunct regimes , Legitimists and Orleanists , eager to feed upon the carcass of the nation \'96 with a tail of antediluvian republicans , sanctioning , by their presence in the Assembly , the slaveholders\'92 rebellion , relying for the maintenance of their parliamentary republic upon the vanity of the senile mountebank at its head , and caricaturing 1789 by holding their ghastly meetings in the\'a0Jeu de Paume  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt (  2  )}}\'a0There it was , this Assembly , the representative of everything dead in France , propped up to the semblance of life by nothing but the swords of the generals of Louis Bonaparte  .  Paris all truth , Versailles all lie ; and that lie vented through the mouth of Thiers  . \
Thiers tells a deputation of the mayors of the Seine-et-Oise \'96 \'93You may rely upon my word , which I have never broken  !\'94\
He tells the Assembly itself that \'93it was the most freely elected and most liberal Assembly France ever possessed  "   ; he tells his motley soldiery that it was \'93the admiration of the world , and the finest army France ever possessed\'94 ; he tells the provinces that the bombardment of Paris by him was a myth  : \'93If some cannon-shots have been fired , it was not the deed of the army of Versailles , but of some insurgents trying to make believe that they are fighting , while they dare not show their faces  . \'94 He again tells the provinces that \'93the artillery of Versailles does not bombard Paris , but only cannonades it  "    .  He tells the Archbishop of Paris that the pretended executions and reprisals (    !  ) attributed to the Versailles troops were all moonshine  .  He tells Paris that he was only anxious \'93to free it from the hideous tyrants who oppress it ,\'94 and that , in fact , the Paris of the Commune was \'93but a handful of criminals  . \'94\
The Paris of M  .  Thiers was not the real Paris of the \'93vile multitude ,\'94 but a phantom Paris , the Paris of the\'a0francs-fileurs ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#N"}}{\fldrslt  [ N ]}}\'a0the Paris of the Boulevards , male and female \'96 the rich , the capitalist , the gilded , the idle Paris , now thronging with its lackeys , its blacklegs , its literary\'a0bonhome , and its\'a0cocottes\'a0at Versailles , Saint-Denis , Rueil , and Saint-Germain ; considering the civil war but an agreeable diversion , eyeing the battle going on through telescopes , counting the rounds of cannon , swearing by their own honor and that of their prostitutes , that the performance was far better got up than it used to be at the Porte St  .  Martin  .  The men who fell were really dead ; the cries of the wounded were cries in good earnest ; and , besides , the whole thing was so intensely historical  . \
This is the Paris of M  .  Thiers , as the emigration of Coblenz was the France of M  .  de Calonne  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm#O"}}{\fldrslt  [ O ]}}\
The first attempt of the slaveholders\'92 conspiracy to put down Paris by getting the Prussians to occupy it was frustrated by Bismarck\'92s refusal  . \
The second attempt , that of March 18 , ended in the rout of the army and the flight to Versailles of the government , which ordered the whole administration to break up and follow in its track  . \
By the semblance of peace negotiations with Paris , Thiers found the time to prepare for war against it  .  But where to find an army  ? The remnants of the line regiments were weak in number and unsafe in character  .  His urgent appeal to the provinces to succour Versailles , by their National Guards and volunteers , met with a flat refusal  .  Brittany alone furnished a handful of\'a0Chouans{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\'a0fighting under a white flag , every one of them wearing on his breast the heart of Jesus in white cloth , and shouting \'93Vive le Roi  !\'94 (  Long live the King  !  )\
Thiers was , therefore , compelled to collect , in hot haste , a motley crew , composed of sailors , marines , Pontifical Zouaves , Valentin\'92s gendarmes , and Pietri\'92s\'a0sergents-de-ville\'a0and\'a0mouchards  .  This army , however , would have been ridiculously ineffective without the instalments of imperialist war prisoners , which Bismarck granted in numbers just sufficient to keep the civil war a-going , and keep the Versailles government in abject dependence on Prussia  .  During the war itself , the Versailles police had to look after the Versailles army , while the gendarmes had to drag it on by exposing themselves at all posts of danger  .  The forts which fell were not taken , but bought  .  The heroism of the Federals convinced Thiers that the resistance of Paris was not to be broken by his own strategic genius and the bayonets at his disposal  . \
Meanwhile , his relations with the provinces became more and more difficult  .  Not one single address of approval came in to gladden Thiers and his Rurals  .  Quite the contrary  .  Deputations and addresses demanding , in a tone anything but respectful , conciliation with Paris on the basis of the unequivocal recognition of the republic , the acknowledgment of the Communal liberties , and the dissolution of the National Assembly , whose mandate was extinct , poured in from all sides , and in such numbers that Dufaure , Thiers\'92 Minister of Justice , in his circular of April 23 to the public prosecutors , commanded them to treat \'93the cry of conciliation\'94 as a crime  ! In regard , however , of the hopeless prospect held out by his campaign , Thiers resolved to shift his tactics by ordering , all over the country , municipal elections to take place on April 30 , on the basis of the new municipal law dictated by himself to the National Assembly  .  What with the intrigues of his prefects , what with police intimidation , he felt quite sanguine of imparting , by the verdict of the provinces , to the National Assembly that moral power it had never possessed , and of getting at last from the provinces the physical force required for the conquest of Paris  . \
His bandit-warfare against Paris , exalted in his own bulletins , and the attempts of his ministers at the establishment , throughout France , of a reign of terror , Thiers was from the beginning anxious to accompany with a little by-play of conciliation , which had to serve more than one purpose  .  It was to dupe the provinces , to inveigle the middle class elements in Paris , and above all , to afford the professed republicans in the National Assembly the opportunity of hiding their treason against Paris behind their faith in Thiers  . \
On March 21 , when still without an army , he had declared to the Assembly  : \'93Come what may , I will not send an army to Paris  . \'94\
On March 27 , he rose again  : \'93I have found the republic an accomplished fact , and I am firmly resolved to maintain it  . \'94\
In reality , he put down the revolution at Lyons and Marseilles{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\'a0in the name of the republic , while the roars of his Rurals drowned the very mention of his name at Versailles  .  After this exploit , he toned down the \'93accomplished fact\'94 into a hypothetical fact  .  The Orleans princes , whom he had cautiously warned off Bordeaux , were now , in flagrant breach of the law , permitted to intrigue at Dreux  .  The concessions held out by Thiers in his interminable interviews with the delegates from Paris and the provinces , although constantly varied in tone and color , according to time and circumstances , did in fact never come to more than the prospective restriction of revenge to the \'93handful of criminals implicated in the murder of Lecomte and Clement Thomas ,\'94 on the well-understood premise that Paris and France were unreservedly to accept M  .  Thiers himself as the best of possible Republics , as he , in 1830 , had done with Louis Philippe , and in 1849 under Louis Bonaparte\'92s presidency  .  While out of office , he made a fortune by pleading for the Paris capitalists , and made political capital by pleading against the laws he had himself originated  .  He now hurried through the National Assembly not only a set of repressive laws which were , after the fall of Paris , to extirpate the last remnants of republican liberty in France ; he foreshadowed the fate of Paris by abridging what was for him the too slow procedure of courts-martial ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}\'a0and by a new-fangled , Draconic code of deportation  .  The Revolution of 1848 , abolishing the penalty of death for political crimes , had replaced it by deportation  .  Louis Bonaparte did not dare , at least not in theory , to re-establish the regime of the guillotine  .  The Rural Assembly , not yet bold enough even to hint that the Parisians were not rebels , but assassins , had therefore to confine its prospective vengeance against Paris to Dufaure\'92s new code of deportation  .  Under all these circumstances , Thiers himself could not have gone on with his comedy of conciliation , had it not , as he intended it to do , drawn forth shrieks of rage from the Rurals , whose ruminating mind did neither understand the play , nor its necessities of hypocrisy , tergiversation , and procrastination  . \
In sight of the impending municipal elections of April 30 , Thiers enacted one of his great conciliation scenes on April 27  .  Amidst a flood of sentiment rhetoric , he exclaimed from the tribune of the Assembly  :\
\'93There exists no conspiracy against the republic but that of Paris , which compels us to shed French blood  .  I repeat it again and again  .  Let those impious arms fall from the hands which hold them , and chastisement will be arrested at once by an act of peace excluding only the small number of criminals  . \'94\
To the violent interruption of the Rurals , he replied  :\
\'93Gentlemen , tell me , I implore you , am I wrong  ? Do you really regret that I could have stated the truth that the criminals are only a handful  ? Is it not fortunate in the midst of our misfortunes that those who have been capable to shed the blood of Clement Thomas and General Lecomte are but rare exceptions  ?\'94\
France , however , turned a deaf ear to what Thiers flattered himself to be a parliamentary siren\'92s song  .  Out of 700 ,000 municipal councillors returned by the 35 ,000 communes still left to France , the united Legitimists , Orleanists , and Bonapartists did not carry 8 ,000  . \
The supplementary elections which followed were still more decidedly hostile  . \
Thus , instead of getting from the provinces the badly-needed physical force , the National Assembly lost even its last claim to moral force , that of being the expression of the universal suffrage of the country  .  To complete the discomfiture , the newly-chosen municipal councils of all the cities of France openly threatened the usurping Assembly at Versailles with a counter assembly at Bordeaux  . \
Then the long-expected moment of decisive action had at last come for Bismarck  .  He peremptorily summoned Thiers to send to Frankfort plenipotentiaries for the definitive settlement of peace  .  In humble obedience to the call of his master , Thiers hastened to despatch his trusty Jules Favre , backed by Pouyer-Quertier  .  Pouyer-Quertier , an \'93eminent\'94 Rouen cotton-spinner , a fervent and even servile partisan of the Second Empire , had never found any fault with it save its commercial treaty with England ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#D"}}{\fldrslt  [ D ]}}\'a0prejudicial to his own shop-interest  .  Hardly installed at Bordeaux as Thiers\'92 Minister of Finance , he denounced that \'93unholy\'94 treaty , hinted at its near abrogation , and had even the effrontery to try , although in vain (  having counted without Bismarck  ) , the immediate enforcement of the old protective duties against Alsace , where , he said , no previous international treaties stood in the way  .  This man who considered counter-revolution as a means to put down wages at Rouen , and the surrender of French provinces as a means to bring up the price of his wares in France , was he not\'a0the one\'a0predestined to be picked out by Thiers as the helpmate of Jules Favre in his last and crowning treason  ?\
On the arrival at Frankfurt of this exquisite pair of plenipotentiaries , bully Bismarck at once met them with the imperious alternative  : Either the restoration of the empire or the unconditional acceptance of my own peace terms  ! These terms included a shortening of the intervals in which war indemnity was to be paid and the continued occupation of the Paris forts by Prussian troops until Bismarck should feel satisfied with the state of things in France ; Prussia thus being recognized as the supreme arbiter in internal French politics  ! In return for this , he offered to let loose for the extermination of Paris the Bonapartist army , and to lend them the direct assistance of Emperor William\'92s troops  .  He pledged his good faith by making payment of the first installment of the indemnity dependent on the \'93pacification\'94 of Paris  .  Such bait was , of course , eagerly swallowed by Thiers and his plenipotentiaries  .  They signed the treaty of peace on May 10 and had it endorsed by the Versailles Assembly on the 18th  . \
In the interval between the conclusion of peace and the arrival of the Bonapartist prisoners , Thiers felt the more bound to resume his comedy of conciliation , as his republican tools stood in sore need of a pretext for blinking their eyes at the preparations for the carnage of Paris  .  As late as May 18 , he replied to a deputation of middle-class conciliators \'96\
\'93Whenever the insurgents will make up their minds for capitulation , the gates of Paris shall be flung wide open during a week for all except the murderers of Generals Clement Thomas and Lecomte  . \'94\
A few days afterwards , when violently interpellated on these promises by the Rurals , he refused to enter into any explanations ; not , however , without giving them this significant hint  :\
\'93I tell you there are impatient men amongst you , men who are in too great a hurry  .  They must have another eight days ; at the end of these eight days there will be no more danger , and the task will be proportionate to their courage and to their capacities  . \'94\
As soon as MacMahon was able to assure him , that he could shortly enter Paris , Thiers declared to the Assembly that\
\'93he would enter Paris with the\'a0laws\'a0in his hands , and demand a full expiation from the wretches who had sacrificed the lives of soldiers and destroyed public monuments  . \'94\
As the moment of decision drew near , he said \'96 to the Assembly , \'93I shall be pitiless  !\'94 \'96 to Paris , that it was doomed ; and to his Bonapartist bandits , that they had state licence to wreak vengeance upon Paris to their hearts\'92 content  . \
At last , when treachery had opened the gates of Paris to General Douai , on May 21 , Thiers , on the 22nd , revealed to the Rurals the \'93goal\'94 of his conciliation comedy , which they had so obstinately persisted in not understanding  . \
\'93I told you a few days ago that we were approaching\'a0our goal ; today I come to tell you\'a0the goal\'a0is reached  .  The victory of order , justice , and civilization is at last won  !\'94\
So it was  .  The civilization and justice of bourgeois order comes out in its lurid light whenever the slaves and drudges of that order rise against their masters  .  Then this civilization and justice stand forth as undisguised savagery and lawless revenge  .  Each new crisis in the class struggle between the appropriator and the producer brings out this fact more glaringly  .  Even the atrocities of the bourgeois in June 1848 vanish before the infamy of 1871  .  The self-sacrificing heroism with which the population of Paris \'96 men , women , and children \'96 fought for eight days after the entrance of the Versaillese , reflects as much the grandeur of their cause , as the infernal deeds of the soldiery reflect the innate spirit of that civilization , indeed , the great problem of which is how to get rid of the heaps of corpses it made after the battle was over  !\
To find a parallel for the conduct of Thiers and his bloodhounds we must go back to the times of Sulla and the two Triumvirates of Rome  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#E"}}{\fldrslt  [ E ]}}\'a0The same wholesale slaughter in cold blood ; the same disregard , in massacre , of age and sex , the same system of torturing prisoners ; the same proscriptions , but this time of a whole class ; the same savage hunt after concealed leaders , lest one might escape ; the same denunciations of political and private enemies ; the same indifference for the butchery of entire strangers to the feud  . \
There is but this difference  : that the Romans had no\'a0mitrailleuses\'a0for the despatch , in the lump , of the proscribed , and that they had not \'93the law in their hands ,\'94 nor on their lips the cry of \'93civilization  . \'94\
And after those horrors look upon the other still more hideous face of the bourgeois civilization as described by its own press  !\
\'93With stray shots ,\'94 writes the Paris correspondent of a London Tory paper , \'93still ringing in the distance , and unintended wounded wretches dying amid the tombstones of Pere la Chaise \'96 with 6 ,000 terror-stricken insurgents wandering in an agony of despair in the labyrinth of the catacombs , and wretches hurried through the streets to be shot down in scores by the\'a0mitrailleuse\'a0\'96 it is revolting to see the cafes filled with the votaries of absinthe , billiards , and dominoes ; female profligacy perambulating the boulevards , and the sound of revelry disturbing the night from the\'a0cabinets particuliers\'a0of fashionable restaurants  . \'94\
M  .  Edouard Herve writes in the\'a0Journal de Paris , a Versaillist journal pressed by the Commune  :\
\'93The way in which the population of Paris  [   ! ] manifested its satisfaction yesterday was rather more than frivolous , and we fear it will grow worse as time progresses  .  Paris has now a\'a0fete\'a0day appearance , which is sadly out of place ; and , unless we are to be called the\'a0Parisiens de la decadence , this sort of thing must come to an end  . \'94\
And then he quotes the passage from Tacitus  :\
\'93Yet , on the morrow of that horrible struggle , even before it was completely over , Rome \'96 degraded and corrupt \'96 began once more to wallow in the voluptuous slough which was destroying its body and pulling its soul \'96\'a0alibi proelia et vulnera , alibi balnea popinoeque\'a0 [ here fights and wounds , there baths and restaurants ]  . \'94\
M  .  Herve only forgets to say that the \'93population of Paris\'94 he speaks of is but the population of the Paris of M  .  Thiers \'96 the\'a0francs-fileursreturning in throngs from Versailles , Saint-Denis , Rueil , and Saint Germain \'96 the Paris of the \'93Decline  . \'94\
In all its bloody triumphs over the self-sacrificing champions of a new and better society , that nefarious civilization , based upon the enslavement of labor , drowns the moans of its victims in a hue-and-cry of calumny , reverberated by a world-wide echo  .  The serene working men\'92s Paris of the Commune is suddenly changed into a pandemonium by the bloodhounds of \'93order  . \'94\
And what does this tremendous change prove to the bourgeois mind of all countries  ? Why , that the Commune has conspired against civilization  ! The Paris people die enthusiastically for the Commune in numbers unequally in any battle known to history  .  What does that prove  ? Why , that the Commune was not the people\'92s own government but the usurpation of a handful of criminals  ! The women of Paris joyfully give up their lives at the barricades and on the place of execution  .  What does this prove  ? Why , that the demon of the Commune has changed them into Megaera and Hecates  !\
The moderation of the Commune during the two months of undisputed sway is equalled only by the heroism of its defence  . \
What does that prove  ? Why , that for months the Commune carefully hid , under a mask of moderation and humanity , the bloodthirstiness of its fiendish instincts to be let loose in the hour of its agony  !\
The working men\'92s Paris , in the act of its heroic self-holocaust , involved in its flames buildings and monuments  .  While tearing to pieces the living body of the proletariat , its rulers must no longer expect to return triumphantly into the intact architecture of their abodes  .  The government of Versailles cries , \'93Incendiarism  !\'94 and whispers this cue to all its agents , down to the remotest hamlet , to hunt up its enemies everywhere as suspect of professional incendiarism  .  The bourgeoisie of the whole world , which looks complacently upon the wholesale massacre after the battle , is convulsed by horror at the desecration of brick and mortar  !\
When governments give state licences to their navies to \'93kill ,\'a0burn , and destroy ,\'94 is that licence for incendiarism  ? When the British troops wantonly set fire to the Capitol at Washington and to the summer palace of the Chinese emperor ,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#F"}}{\fldrslt  [ F ]}}\'a0was that incendiarism  ? When the Prussians not for military reasons , but out of the mere spite of revenge , burned down , by the help of petroleum , towns like Chateaudun and innumerable villages , was that incendiarism  ? When Thiers , during six weeks , bombarded Paris , under the pretext that he wanted to set fire to those houses only in which there were people , was that incendiarism  ? \'96 In war , fire is an arm as legitimate as any  .  Buildings held by the enemy are shelled to set them on fire  .  If their defenders have to retire , they themselves light the flames to prevent the attack from making use of the buildings  .  To be burned down has always been the inevitable fate of all buildings situated in the front of battle of all the regular armies of the world  . \
But in the war of the enslaved against their enslavers , the only justifiable war in history , this is by no means to hold good  ! The Commune used fire strictly as a means of defence  .  They used it to stop up to the Versailles troops those long , straight avenues which Haussman had expressly opened to artillery-fire ; they used it to cover their retreat , in the same way as the Versaillese , in their advance , used their shells which destroyed at least as many buildings as the fire of the Commune  .  It is a matter of dispute , even now , which buildings were set fire to by the defence , and which by the attack  .  And the defence resorted to fire only then when the Versailles troops had already commenced their wholesale murdering of prisoners  . \
Besides , the Commune had , long before , given full public notice that if driven to extremities , they would bury themselves under the ruins of Paris , and make Paris a second Moscow , as the Government of National Defence , but only as a cloak for its treason , had promised to do  .  For this purpose Trochu had found them the petroleum  .  The Commune knew that its opponents cared nothing for the lives of the Paris people , but cared much for their own Paris buildings  .  And Thiers , on the other hand , had given them notice that he would be implacable in his vengeance  .  No sooner had he got his army ready on one side , and the Prussians shutting the trap on the other , than he proclaimed  : \'93I shall be pitiless  ! The expiation will be complete , and justice will be stern  !\'94 If the acts of the Paris working men were vandalism , it was the vandalism of defence in despair , not the vandalism of triumph , like that which the Christians perpetrated upon the really priceless art treasures of heathen antiquity ; and even that vandalism has been justified by the historian as an unavoidable and comparatively trifling concomitant to the titanic struggle between a new society arising and an old one breaking down  .  It was still less the vandalism of Haussman , razing historic Paris to make place for the Paris of the sightseer  !\
But the execution by the Commune of the 64 hostages , with the Archbishop of Paris at their head  ! The bourgeoisie and its army , in June 1848 , re-established a custom which had long disappeared from the practice of war \'96 the shooting of their defenceless prisoners  .  This brutal custom has since been more or less strictly adhered to by the suppressors of all popular commotions in Europe and India ; thus proving that it constitutes a real \'93progress of civilization\'94  !\
On the other hand , the Prussians in France , had re-established the practice of taking hostages \'96 innocent men , who , with their lives , were to answer to them for the acts of others  .  When Thiers , as we have seen , from the very beginning of the conflict , enforced the human practice of shooting down the Communal prisoners , the Commune , to protect their lives , was obliged to resort to the Prussian practice of securing hostages  .  The lives of the hostages have been forfeited over and over again by the continued shooting of prisoners on the part of the Versaillese  .  How could they be spared any longer after the carnage with which MacMahon\'92s praetorians{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#G"}}{\fldrslt  [ G ]}}\'a0celebrated their entrance into Paris  ?\
Was even the last check upon the unscrupulous ferocity of bourgeois governments \'96 the taking of hostages \'96 to be made a mere sham of  ?\
The real murderer of Archbishop Darboy is Thiers  .  The Commune again and again had offered to exchange the archbishop , and ever so many priests in the bargain , against the single Blanqui , then in the hands of Thiers  .  Thiers obstinately refused  .  He knew that with Blanqui he would give the Commune a head ; while the archbishop would serve his purpose best in the shape of a corpse  . \
Thiers acted upon the precedent of Cavaignac  .  How , in June 1848 , did not Cavaignac and his men of order raise shouts of horror by stigmatizing the insurgents as the assassins of Archbishop Affre  ! They knew perfectly well that the archbishop had been shot by the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch03.htm#F"}}{\fldrslt soldiers of order}}  .  M  .  Jacquemet , the archbishop\'92s vicar-general , present on the spot , had immediately afterwards handed them in his evidence to that effect  . \
All the chorus of calumny , which the Party of Order never fail , in their orgies of blood , to raise against their victims , only proves that the bourgeois of our days considers himself the legitimate successor to the baron of old , who thought every weapon in his own hand fair against the plebeian , while in the hands of the plebeian a weapon of any kind constituted in itself a crime  . \
The conspiracy of the ruling class to break down the revolution by a civil war carried on under the patronage of the foreign invader \'96 a conspiracy which we have traced from the very 4th of September down to the entrance of MacMahon\'92s praetorians through the gate of St  .  Cloud \'96 culminated in the carnage of Paris  .  Bismarck gloats over the ruins of Paris , in which he saw perhaps the first installment of that general destruction of great cities he had prayed for when still a simple Rural in the Prussian\'a0Chambre introuvable\'a0of 1849  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch06.htm#H"}}{\fldrslt  [ H ]}}\'a0He gloats over the cadavers of the Paris proletariat  .  For him , this is not only the extermination of revolution , but the extinction of France , now decapitated in reality , and by the French government itself  .  With the shallowness characteristic of all successful statesmen , he sees but the surface of this tremendous historic event  .  Whenever before has history exhibited the spectacle of a conqueror crowning his victory by turning into , not only the gendarme , but the hired bravo of the conquered government  ? There existed no war between Prussia and the Commune of Paris  .  On the contrary , the Commune had accepted the peace preliminaries , and Prussia had announced her neutrality  .  Prussia was , therefore , no belligerent  .  She acted the part of a bravo , a cowardly bravo , because incurring no danger ; a hired bravo , because stipulating beforehand the payment of her blood-money of 500 millions on the fall of Paris  .  And thus , at last , came out the true character of the war , ordained by Providence , as a chastisement of godless and debauched France by pious and moral Germany  ! And this unparalleled breach of the law of nations , even as understood by the old-world lawyers , instead of arousing the \'93civilized\'94 governments of Europe to declare the felonious Prussian government , the mere tool of the St  .  Petersburg Cabinet , an outlaw amongst nations , only incites them to consider whether the few victims who escape the double cordon around Paris are not to be given up to the hangman of Versailles  !\
That , after the most tremendous war of modern times , the conquering and the conquered hosts should fraternize for the common massacre of the proletariat \'96 this unparalleled event does indicate , not , as Bismarck thinks , the final repression of a new society up heaving , but the crumbling into dust of bourgeois society  .  The highest heroic effort of which old society is still capable is national war ; and this is now proved to be a mere governmental humbug , intended to defer the struggle of classes , and to be thrown aside as soon as that class struggle bursts out into civil war  .  Class rule is no longer able to disguise itself in a national uniform ; the national governments are\'a0oneas against the proletariat  !\
After Whit-Sunday , 1871 , there can be neither peace nor truce possible between the working men of France and the appropriators of their produce  .  The iron hand of a mercenary soldiery may keep for a time both classes tied down in common oppression  .  But the battle must break out again and again in ever-growing dimensions , and there can be no doubt as to who will be the victor in the end \'96 the appropriating few , or the immense working majority  .  And the French working class is only the advanced guard of the modern proletariat  . \
While the European governments thus testify , before Paris , to the international character of class rule , they cry down the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/i/n.htm#iwma"}}{\fldrslt International Working Men\'92s Association}}\'a0\'96 the international counter-organization of labor against the cosmopolitan conspiracy of capital \'96 as the head fountain of all these disasters  .  Thiers denounced it as the despot of labor , pretending to be its liberator  .  Picard ordered that all communications between the French Internationals and those abroad be cut off ; Count Jaubert , Thiers\'92 mummified accomplice of 1835 , declares it the great problem of all civilized governments to weed it out  .  The Rurals roar against it , and the whole European press joins the chorus  .  An honorable French writer  [ Robinet ] , completely foreign to our Association , speaks as follows  :\
\'93The members of the Central Committee of the National Guard , as well as the greater part of the members of the Commune , are the most active , intelligent , and energetic minds of the International Working Men\'92s Association  .   .   .  men who are thoroughly honest , sincere , intelligent , devoted , pure , and fanatical in the\'a0good\'a0sense of the word  . \'94\
The police-tinged bourgeois mind naturally figures to itself the International Working Men\'92s Association as acting in the manner of a secret conspiracy , its central body ordering , from time to time , explosions in different countries  .  Our Association is , in fact , nothing but the international bond between the most advanced working men in the various countries of the civilized world  .  Wherever , in whatever shape , and under whatever conditions the class struggle obtains any consistency , it is but natural that members of our Association , should stand in the foreground  .  The soil out of which it grows is modern society itself  .  It cannot be stamped out by any amount of carnage  .  To stamp it out , the governments would have to stamp out the despotism of capital over labor \'96 the condition of their own parasitical existence  . \
Working men\'92s Paris , with its Commune , will be forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society  .  Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class  .  Its exterminators history has already nailed to that eternal pillory from which all the prayers of their priest will not avail to redeem them  . \
First part of the paragraph  :   "  Labor is the source of all wealth and all culture  .   "  \
Labor is\'a0not the source\'a0of all wealth  . \'a0Nature\'a0is just as much the source of use values (  and it is surely of such that material wealth consists  !  ) as labor , which itself is only the manifestation of a force of nature , human labor power  .  the above phrase is to be found in all children's primers and is correct insofar as it is implied that labor is performed with the appurtenant subjects and instruments  .  But a socialist program cannot allow such bourgeois phrases to pass over in silence the\'a0conditions\'a0that lone give them meaning  .  And insofar as man from the beginning behaves toward nature , the primary source of all instruments and subjects of labor , as an owner , treats her as belonging to him , his labor becomes the source of use values , therefore also of wealth  .  The bourgeois have very good grounds for falsely ascribing\'a0supernatural creative power\'a0to labor ; since precisely from the fact that labor depends on nature it follows that the man who possesses no other property than his labor power must , in all conditions of society and culture , be the slave of other men who have made themselves the owners of the material conditions of labor  .  He can only work with their permission , hence live only with their permission  . \
Let us now leave the sentence as it stands , or rather limps  .  What could one have expected in conclusion  ? Obviously this  :\
  "  Since labor is the source of all wealth , no one in society can appropriate wealth except as the product of labor  .  Therefore , if he himself does not work , he lives by the labor of others and also acquires his culture at the expense of the labor of others  .   "  \
Instead of this , by means of the verbal river   "  and since  "   , a proposition is added in order to draw a conclusion from this and not from the first one  . \
\
Second part of the paragraph  :   "  Useful labor is possible only in society and through society  .   "  \
According to the first proposition , labor was the source of all wealth and all culture ; therefore no society is possible without labor  .  Now we learn , conversely , that no   "  useful  "   labor is possible without society  . \
One could just as well have said that only in society can useless and even socially harmful labor become a branch of gainful occupation , that only in society can one live by being idle , etc  .  , etc  .  \'96 in short , once could just as well have copied the whole of Rousseau  . \
And what is   "  useful  "   labor  ? Surely only labor which produces the intended useful result  .  A savage \'96 and man was a savage after he had ceased to be an ape \'96 who kills an animal with a stone , who collects fruit , etc  .  , performs   "  useful  "   labor  . \
\
Thirdly , the conclusion  :   "  Useful labor is possible only in society and through society , the proceeds of labor belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society  .   "  \
A fine conclusion  ! If useful labor is possible only in society and through society , the proceeds of labor belong to society \'96 and only so much therefrom accrues to the individual worker as is not required to maintain the   "  condition  "   of labor , society  . \
In fact , this proposition has at all times been made use of by the champions of the\'a0state of society prevailing at any given time  .  First comes the claims of the government and everything that sticks to it , since it is the social organ for the maintenance of the social order ; then comes the claims of the various kinds of private property , for the various kinds of private property are the foundations of society , etc  .  One sees that such hollow phrases are the foundations of society , etc  .  One sees that such hollow phrases can be twisted and turned as desired  . \
The first and second parts of the paragraph have some intelligible connection only in the following wording  :\
  "  Labor becomes the source of wealth and culture only as social labor  "   , or , what is the same thing ,   "  in and through society  "    . \
This proposition is incontestably correct , for although isolated labor (  its material conditions presupposed  ) can create use value , it can create neither wealth nor culture  . \
But equally incontestable is this other proposition  :\
  "  In proportion as labor develops socially , and becomes thereby a source of wealth and culture , poverty and destitution develop among the workers , and wealth and culture among the nonworkers  .   "  \
This is the law of all history hitherto  .  What , therefore , had to be done here , instead of setting down general phrases about   "  labor  "   and   "  society  "   , was to prove concretely how in present capitalist society the material , etc  .  , conditions have at last been created which enable and compel the workers to lift this social curse  . \
In fact , however , the whole paragraph , bungled in style and content , is only there in order to inscribe the Lassallean catchword of the   "  undiminished proceeds of labor  "   as a slogan at the top of the party banner  .  I shall return later to the   "  proceeds of labor  "   ,   "  equal right  "   , etc  .  , since the same thing recurs in a somewhat different form further on  . \
\
2  .    "  In present-day society , the instruments of labor are the monopoly of the capitalist class ; the resulting dependence of the working class is the cause of misery and servitude in all forms  .   "  \
This sentence , borrowed from the Rules of the International , is incorrect in this   "  improved  "   edition  . \
In present-day society , the instruments of labor are the monopoly of the landowners (  the monopoly of property in land is even the basis of the monopoly of capital  )\'a0and\'a0the capitalists  .  In the passage in question , the Rules of the International do not mention either one or the other class of monopolists  .  They speak of the   "  monopolizer of the means of labor , that is ,\'a0the sources of life  .   "   The addition ,   "  sources of life  "   , makes it sufficiently clear that land is included in the instruments of labor  . \
The correction was introduced because Lassalle , for reasons now generally known , attacked\'a0only\'a0the capitalist class and not the landowners  .  In England , the capitalist class is usually not even the owner of the land on which his factory stands  . \
\
3  .    "  The emancipation of labor demands the promotion of the instruments of labor to the common property of society and the co-operative regulation of the total labor , with a fair distribution of the proceeds of labor  . \
  "  Promotion of the instruments of labor to the common property  "   ought obviously to read their   "  conversion into the common property  "   ; but this is only passing  . \
What are the   "  proceeds of labor  "    ? The product of labor , or its value  ? And in the latter case , is it the total value of the product , or only that part of the value which labor has newly added to the value of the means of production consumed  ?\
  "  Proceeds of labor  "   is a loose notion which Lassalle has put in the place of definite economic conceptions  . \
What is   "  a fair distribution  "    ?\
Do not the bourgeois assert that the present-day distribution is   "  fair  "    ? And is it not , in fact , the only   "  fair  "   distribution on the basis of the present-day mode of production  ? Are economic relations regulated by legal conceptions , or do not , on the contrary , legal relations arise out of economic ones  ? Have not also the socialist sectarians the most varied notions about   "  fair  "   distribution  ?\
To understand what is implied in this connection by the phrase   "  fair distribution  "   , we must take the first paragraph and this one together  .  The latter presupposes a society wherein the instruments of labor are common property and the total labor is co-operatively regulated , and from the first paragraph we learn that   "  the proceeds of labor belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society  .   "  \
  "  To all members of society  "    ? To those who do not work as well  ? What remains then of the   "  undiminished  "   proceeds of labor  ? Only to those members of society who work  ? What remains then of the   "  equal right  "   of all members of society  ?\
But   "  all members of society  "   and   "  equal right  "   are obviously mere phrases  .  The kernel consists in this , that in this communist society every worker must receive the   "  undiminished  "   Lassallean   "  proceeds of labor  "    . \
Let us take , first of all , the words   "  proceeds of labor  "   in the sense of the product of labor ; then the co-operative proceeds of labor are the\'a0total social product  . \
From this must now be deducted  :\'a0First , cover for replacement of the means of production used up  . \'a0Second , additional portion for expansion of production  . \'a0Third , reserve or insurance funds to provide against accidents , dislocations caused by natural calamities , etc  . \
These deductions from the   "  undiminished  "   proceeds of labor are an economic necessity , and their magnitude is to be determined according to available means and forces , and partly by computation of probabilities , but they are in no way calculable by equity  . \
There remains the other part of the total product , intended to serve as means of consumption  . \
Before this is divided among the individuals , there has to be deducted again , from it  :\'a0First , the general costs of administration not belonging to production  .  This part will , from the outset , be very considerably restricted in comparison with present-day society , and it diminishes in proportion as the new society develops  . \'a0Second , that which is intended for the common satisfaction of needs , such as schools , health services , etc  .  From the outset , this part grows considerably in comparison with present-day society , and it grows in proportion as the new society develops  . \'a0Third , funds for those unable to work , etc  .  , in short , for what is included under so-called official poor relief today  . \
Only now do we come to the   "  distribution  "   which the program , under Lassallean influence , alone has in view in its narrow fashion \'96 namely , to that part of the means of consumption which is divided among the individual producers of the co-operative society  . \
The   "  undiminished  "   proceeds of labor have already unnoticeably become converted into the   "  diminished  "   proceeds , although what the producer is deprived of in his capacity as a private individual benefits him directly or indirectly in his capacity as a member of society  . \
Just as the phrase of the   "  undiminished  "   proceeds of labor has disappeared , so now does the phrase of the   "  proceeds of labor  "   disappear altogether  . \
Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production , the producers do not exchange their products ; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the\'a0value\'a0of these products , as a material quality possessed by them , since now , in contrast to capitalist society , individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of total labor  .  The phrase   "  proceeds of labor  "   , objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity , thus loses all meaning  . \
What we have to deal with here is a communist society , not as it has\'a0developed\'a0on its own foundations , but , on the contrary , just as it\'a0emerges\'a0from capitalist society ; which is thus in every respect , economically , morally , and intellectually , still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges  .  Accordingly , the individual producer receives back from society \'96 after the deductions have been made \'96 exactly what he gives to it  .  What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor  .  For example , the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work ; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him , his share in it  .  He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (  after deducting his labor for the common funds  ) ; and with this certificate , he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost  .  The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form , he receives back in another  . \
Here , obviously , the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities , as far as this is exchange of equal values  .  Content and form are changed , because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor , and because , on the other hand , nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals , except individual means of consumption  .  But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned , the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents  : a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form  . \
Hence ,\'a0equal right\'a0here is still in principle \'96\'a0bourgeois right , although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads , while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case  . \
In spite of this advance , this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation  .  The right of the producers is\'a0proportional\'a0to the labor they supply ; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an\'a0equal standard , labor  . \
But one man is superior to another physically , or mentally , and supplies more labor in the same time , or can labor for a longer time ; and labor , to serve as a measure , must be defined by its duration or intensity , otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement  .  This\'a0equal\'a0right is an unequal right for unequal labor  .  It recognizes no class differences , because everyone is only a worker like everyone else ; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment , and thus productive capacity , as a natural privilege  .  It is , therefore , a right of inequality , in its content , like every right  .  Right , by its very nature , can consist only in the application of an equal standard ; but unequal individuals (  and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal  ) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view , are taken from one definite side only \'96 for instance , in the present case , are regarded\'a0only as workers\'a0and nothing more is seen in them , everything else being ignored  .  Further , one worker is married , another is not ; one has more children than another , and so on and so forth  .  Thus , with an equal performance of labor , and hence an equal in the social consumption fund , one will in fact receive more than another , one will be richer than another , and so on  .  To avoid all these defects , right , instead of being equal , would have to be unequal  . \
But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society  .  Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby  . \
In a higher phase of communist society , after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor , and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor , has vanished ; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want ; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual , and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly \'96 only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners  : From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs  !\
I have dealt more at length with the   "  undiminished  "   proceeds of labor , on the one hand , and with   "  equal right  "   and   "  fair distribution  "   , on the other , in order to show what a crime it is to attempt , on the one hand , to force on our Party again , as dogmas , ideas which in a certain period had some meaning but have now become obsolete verbal rubbish , while again perverting , on the other , the realistic outlook , which it cost so much effort to instill into the Party but which has now taken root in it , by means of ideological nonsense about right and other trash so common among the democrats and French socialists  . \
Quite apart from the analysis so far given , it was in general a mistake to make a fuss about so-called distribution and put the principal stress on it  . \
Any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves  .  The latter distribution , however , is a feature of the mode of production itself  .  The capitalist mode of production , for example , rests on the fact that the material conditions of production are in the hands of nonworkers in the form of property in capital and land , while the masses are only owners of the personal condition of production , of labor power  .  If the elements of production are so distributed , then the present-day distribution of the means of consumption results automatically  .  If the material conditions of production are the co-operative property of the workers themselves , then there likewise results a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present one  .  Vulgar socialism (  and from it in turn a section of the democrats  ) has taken over from the bourgeois economists the consideration and treatment of distribution as independent of the mode of production and hence the presentation of socialism as turning principally on distribution  .  After the real relation has long been made clear , why retrogress again  ?\
\
4  .    "  The emancipation of labor must be the work of the working class , relative to which all other classes are only one reactionary mass  .   "  \
The first strophe is taken from the introductory words of the Rules of the International , but   "  improved  "    .  There it is said  :   "  The emancipation of the working class must be the act of the workers themselves  "   ; here , on the contrary , the   "  working class  "   has to emancipate \'96 what  ?   "  Labor  .   "   Let him understand who can  . \
In compensation , the antistrophe , on the other hand , is a Lassallean quotation of the first water  :   "  relative to which  "   (  the working class  )   "  all other classes are only one reactionary mass  .   "  \
In the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm"}}{\fldrslt Communist Manifesto}}\'a0it is said  :\
  "  Of all the classes that stand face-to-face with the bourgeoisie today , the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class  .  The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry ; the proletariat is its special and essential product  .   "  \
The bourgeoisie is here conceived as a revolutionary class \'96 as the bearer of large-scale industry \'96 relative to the feudal lords and the lower middle class , who desire to maintain all social positions that are the creation of obsolete modes of production  .  thus , they do not form together with the bourgeoisie   "  only one reactionary mass  "    . \
On the other hand , the proletariat is revolutionary relative to the bourgeoisie because , having itself grown up on the basis of large-scale industry , it strives to strip off from production the capitalist character that the bourgeoisie seeks to perpetuate  .  But the\'a0Manifesto\'a0adds that the   "  lower middle class  "   is becoming revolutionary   "  in view of  [ its ] impending transfer to the proletariat  "    . \
From this point of view , therefore , it is again nonsense to say that it , together with the bourgeoisie , and with the feudal lords into the bargain ,   "  form only one reactionary mass  "   relative to the working class  . \
Has one proclaimed to the artisan , small manufacturers , etc  .  , and peasants during the last elections  : Relative to us , you , together with the bourgeoisie and feudal lords , form one reactionary mass  ?\
Lassalle knew the\'a0Communist Manifesto\'a0by heart , as his faithful followers know the gospels written by him  .  If , therefore , he has falsified it so grossly , this has occurred only to put a good color on his alliance with absolutist and feudal opponents against the bourgeoisie  . \
In the above paragraph , moreover , his oracular saying is dragged in by main force without any connection with the botched quotation from the Rules of the International  .  Thus , it is simply an impertinence , and indeed not at all displeasing to Herr Bismarck , one of those cheap pieces of insolence in which the Marat of Berlin deals  . \'a0 [  Marat of Berlin a reference to Hasselmann , cheif editor of the\'a0Neuer Social-Demokrat ]\
\
5  .    "  The working class strives for its emancipation first of all within the framework of the present-day national states , conscious that the necessary result of its efforts , which are common to the workers of all civilized countries , will be the international brotherhood of peoples  .   "  \
Lassalle , in opposition to the\'a0Communist Manifesto\'a0and to all earlier socialism , conceived the workers' movement from the narrowest national standpoint  .  He is being followed in this \'96 and that after the work of the International  !\
It is altogether self-evident that , to be able to fight at all , the working class must organize itself at home\'a0as a class\'a0and that its own country is the immediate arena of its struggle \'96 insofar as its class struggle is national , not in substance , but , as the\'a0Communist Manifesto\'a0says ,   "  in form  "    .  But the   "  framework of the present-day national state  "   , for instance , the German Empire , is itself , in its turn , economically   "  within the framework  "   of the world market , politically   "  within the framework  "   of the system of states  .  Every businessman knows that German trade is at the same time foreign trade , and the greatness of Herr Bismarck consists , to be sure , precisely in his pursuing a kind of\'a0international\'a0policy  . \
And to what does the German Workers' party reduce its internationalism  ? To the consciousness that the result of its efforts will be   "  the international brotherhood of peoples  "   \'96 a phrase borrowed from the bourgeois\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#league-peace-freedom"}}{\fldrslt League of Peace and Freedom}} , which is intended to pass as equivalent to the international brotherhood of working classes in the joint struggle against the ruling classes and their governments  .  Not a word , therefore , about the international functions of the German working class  ! And it is thus that it is to challenge its own bourgeoisie \'96 which is already linked up in brotherhood against it with the bourgeois of all other countries \'96 and Herr Bismarck's international policy of conspiracy  . \
In fact , the internationalism of the program stands\'a0even infinitely below\'a0that of the Free Trade party  .  The latter also asserts that the result of its efforts will be   "  the international brotherhood of peoples  "    .  But it also\'a0does\'a0something to make trade international and by no means contents itself with the consciousness that all people are carrying on trade at home  . \
The international activity of the working classes does not in any way depend on the existence of the International Working Men's Association  .  This was only the first attempt to create a central organ for the activity ; an attempt which was a lasting success on account of the impulse which it gave but which was no longer realizable in its historical form after the fall of the Paris Commune  . \
Bismarck's\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/periodicals/n/o.htm#norddeutsche-allgemeine-zeitung"}}{\fldrslt Norddeutsche}}\'a0was absolutely right when it announced , to the satisfaction of its master , that the German Workers' party had sworn off internationalism in the new program  . \
I shall return to the   "  free  "   state later  . \
So , in future , the German Workers' party has got to believe in Lassalle's   "  iron law of wages  "    ! That this may not be lost , the nonsense is perpetrated of speaking of the   "  abolition of the wage system  "   (  it should read  : system of wage labor  ) ,   "  together with the iron law of wages  "    .  If I abolish wage labor , then naturally I abolish its laws also , whether they are of   "  iron  "   or sponge  .  But Lassalle's attack on wage labor turns almost solely on this so-called law  .  In order , therefore , to prove that Lassalle's sect has conquered , the   "  wage system  "   must be abolished   "  together with the iron law of wages  "   and not without it  . \
It is well known that nothing of the   "  iron law of wages  "   is Lassalle's except the word   "  iron  "   borrowed from Goethe's   "  great , eternal iron laws  "    . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch02.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\'a0The word   "  iron  "   is a label by which the true believers recognize one another  .  But if I take the law with Lassalle's stamp on it , and consequently in his sense , then I must also take it with his substantiation for it  .  And what is that  ? As Lange already showed , shortly after Lassalle's death , it is the Malthusian theory of population (  preached by Lange himself  )  .  But if this theory is correct , then again I cannot abolish the law even if I abolish wage labor a hundred times over , because the law then governs not only the system of wage labor but\'a0every\'a0social system  .  Basing themselves directly on this , the economists have been proving for 50 years and more that socialism cannot abolish poverty , which has its basis in nature , but can only make it\'a0general , distribute it simultaneously over the whole surface of society  !\
But all this is not the main thing  .  Quite apart from the false Lassallean formulation of the law , the truly outrageous retrogression consists in the following  :\
Since Lassalle's death , there has asserted itself in our party the scientific understanding that wages are not what they appear to be -- namely , the\'a0value , or\'a0price , of\'a0labor\'97but only a masked form for the\'a0value , or\'a0price , of\'a0labor power  .  Thereby , the whole bourgeois conception of wages hitherto , as well as all the criticism hitherto directed against this conception , was thrown overboard once and for all  .  It was made clear that the wage worker has permission to work for his own subsistence\'97that is ,\'a0to live , only insofar as he works for a certain time gratis for the capitalist (  and hence also for the latter's co-consumers of surplus value  ) ; that the whole capitalist system of production turns on the increase of this gratis labor by extending the working day , or by developing the productivity\'97that is , increasing the intensity or labor power , etc  .  ; that , consequently , the system of wage labor is a system of slavery , and indeed of a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social productive forces of labor develop , whether the worker receives better or worse payment  .  And after this understanding has gained more and more ground in our party , some return to Lassalle's dogma although they must have known that Lassalle\'a0did not know\'a0what wages were , but , following in the wake of the bourgeois economists , took the appearance for the essence of the matter  . \
It is as if , among slaves who have at last got behind the secret of slavery and broken out in rebellion , a slave still in thrall to obsolete notions were to inscribe on the program of the rebellion  : Slavery must be abolished because the feeding of slaves in the system of slavery cannot exceed a certain low maximum  !\
Does not the mere fact that the representatives of our party were capable of perpetrating such a monstrous attack on the understanding that has spread among the mass of our party prove , by itself , with what criminal levity and with what lack of conscience they set to work in drawing up this compromise program  !\
Instead of the indefinite concluding phrase of the paragraph ,   "  the elimination of all social and political inequality  "   , it ought to have been said that with the abolition of class distinctions all social and political inequality arising from them would disappear of itself  . \
After the Lassallean   "  iron law of wages  "   , the physic of the prophet  .  The way to it is   "  paved  "   in worthy fashion  .  In place of the existing class struggle appears a newspaper scribbler's phrase  :   "  the social\'a0question  "   , to the   "  solution  "   of which one   "  paves the way  "    . \
Instead of arising from the revolutionary process of transformation of society , the   "  socialist organization of the total labor  "     "  arises  "   from the   "  state aid  "   that the state gives to the producers' co-operative societies and which the\'a0state , not the workers ,   "  calls into being  "    .  It is worthy of Lassalle's imagination that with state loans one can build a new society just as well as a new railway  !\
From the remnants of a sense of shame ,   "  state aid  "   has been put -- under the democratic control of the   "  toiling people  "    . \
In the first place , the majority of the   "  toiling people  "   in Germany consists of peasants , not proletarians  . \
Second ,   "  democratic  "   means in German   "  Volksherrschaftlich  "  \'a0 [ by the rule of the people ]  .  But what does   "  control by the rule of the people of the toiling people  "   mean  ? And particularly in the case of a toiling people which , through these demands that it puts to the state , expresses its full consciousness that it neither rules nor is ripe for ruling  !\
It would be superfluous to deal here with the criticism of the recipe prescribed by Buchez in the reign of Louis Philippe , in opposition to the French socialists and accepted by the reactionary workers , of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/periodicals/l/a.htm#l-atelier"}}{\fldrslt Atelier}}  .  The chief offense does not lie in having inscribed this specific nostrum in the program , but in taking , in general , a retrograde step from the standpoint of a class movement to that of a sectarian movement  . \
That the workers desire to establish the conditions for co-operative production on a social scale , and first of all on a national scale , in their own country , only means that they are working to revolutionize the present conditions of production , and it has nothing in common with the foundation of co-operative societies with state aid  .  But as far as the present co-operative societies are concerned , they are of value\'a0only\'a0insofar as they are the independent creations of the workers and not prot\'e9g\'e9s either of the governments or of the bourgeois  . \
First of all , according to II , the German Workers' party strives for   "  the free state  "    . \
Free state \'97 what is this  ?\
It is by no means the aim of the workers , who have got rid of the narrow mentality of humble subjects , to set the state free  .  In the German Empire , the   "  state  "   is almost as   "  free  "   as in Russia  .  Freedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed upon society into one completely subordinate to it ; and today , too , the forms of state are more free or less free to the extent that they restrict the   "  freedom of the state  "    . \
The German Workers' party \'97 at least if it adopts the program \'97 shows that its socialist ideas are not even skin-deep ; in that , instead of treating existing society (  and this holds good for any future one  ) as the\'a0basis\'a0of the existing state (  or of the future state in the case of future society  ) , it treats the state rather as an independent entity that possesses its own intellectual , ethical , and libertarian bases  . \
And what of the riotous misuse which the program makes of the words   "  present-day state  "   ,   "  present-day society  "   , and of the still more riotous misconception it creates in regard to the state to which it addresses its demands  ?\
  "  Present-day society  "   is capitalist society , which exists in all civilized countries , more or less free from medieval admixture , more or less modified by the particular historical development of each country , more or less developed  .  On the other hand , the   "  present-day state  "   changes with a country's frontier  .  It is different in the Prusso-German Empire from what it is in Switzerland , and different in England from what it is in the United States  .  The   "  present-day state  "   is therefore a fiction  . \
Nevertheless , the different states of the different civilized countries , in spite or their motley diversity of form , all have this in common  : that they are based on modern bourgeois society , only one more or less capitalistically developed  .  They have , therefore , also certain essential characteristics in common  .  In this sense , it is possible to speak of the   "  present-day state  "   in contrast with the future , in which its present root , bourgeois society , will have died off  . \
The question then arises  : What transformation will the state undergo in communist society  ? In other words , what social functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to present state functions  ? This question can only be answered scientifically , and one does not get a flea-hop nearer to the problem by a thousand-fold combination of the word 'people' with the word 'state'  . \
Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other  .  Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but\'a0the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat  . \
Now the program does not deal with this nor with the future state of communist society  . \
Its political demands contain nothing beyond the old democratic litany familiar to all  : universal suffrage , direct legislation , popular rights , a people's militia , etc  .  They are a mere echo of the bourgeois\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/p/e.htm#peoples-party"}}{\fldrslt People's party}} , of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#league-peace-freedom"}}{\fldrslt League of Peace and Freedom}}  .  They are all demands which , insofar as they are not exaggerated in fantastic presentation , have already been\'a0realized  .  Only the state to which they belong does not lie within the borders of the German Empire , but in Switzerland , the United States , etc  .  This sort of   "  state of the future  "   is a present-day state , although existing outside the   "  framework  "   of the German Empire  . \
But one thing has been forgotten  .  Since the German Workers' party expressly declares that it acts within   "  the present-day national state  "   , hence within its own state , the Prusso-German Empire \'97 its demands would indeed be otherwise largely meaningless , since one only demands what one has not got \'97 it should not have forgotten the chief thing , namely , that all those pretty little gewgaws rest on the recognition of the so-called sovereignty of the people and hence are appropriate only in a\'a0democratic republic  . \
Since one has not the courage \'97 and wisely so , for the circumstances demand caution \'97 to demand the democratic republic , as the French workers' programs under Louis Philippe and under Louis Napoleon did , one should not have resorted , either , to the subterfuge , neither   "  honest  "  \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch04.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}}\'a0nor decent , of demanding things which have meaning only in a democratic republic from a state which is nothing but a police-guarded military despotism , embellished with parliamentary forms , alloyed with a feudal admixture , already influenced by the bourgeoisie , and bureaucratically carpentered , and then to assure this state into the bargain that one imagines one will be able to force such things upon it   "  by legal means  "    . \
Even vulgar democracy , which sees the millennium in the democratic republic , and has no suspicion that it is precisely in this last form of state of bourgeois society that the class struggle has to be fought out to a conclusion \'97 even it towers mountains above this kind of democratism , which keeps within the limits of what is permitted by the police and not permitted by logic  . \
That , in fact , by the word   "  state  "   is meant the government machine , or the state insofar as it forms a special organism separated from society through division of labor , is shown by the words   "  the German Workers' party demands as the economic basis of the state  : a single progressive income tax  "   , etc  .  Taxes are the economic basis of the government machinery and of nothing else  .  In the state of the future , existing in Switzerland , this demand has been pretty well fulfilled  .  Income tax presupposes various sources of income of the various social classes , and hence capitalist society  .  It is , therefore , nothing remarkable that the Liverpool financial reformers \'97 bourgeois headed by Gladstone's brother \'97 are putting forward the same demand as the program  . \
\
B  .    "  The German Workers' party demands as the intellectual and ethical basis of the state  :\'a0\uc0\u8232   "  1  .  Universal and equal elementary education by the state  .  Universal compulsory school attendance  .  Free instruction  .   "  \
  "  Equal elementary education  "    ? What idea lies behind these words  ? Is it believed that in present-day society (  and it is only with this one has to deal  ) education can be\'a0equal\'a0for all classes  ? Or is it demanded that the upper classes also shall be compulsorily reduced to the modicum of education \'97 the elementary school \'97 that alone is compatible with the economic conditions not only of the wage-workers but of the peasants as well  ?\
  "  Universal compulsory school attendance  .  Free instruction  .   "   The former exists even in Germany , the second in Switzerland and in the United States in the case of elementary schools  .  If in some states of the latter country higher education institutions are also   "  free  "   , that only means in fact defraying the cost of education of the upper classes from the general tax receipts  .  Incidentally , the same holds good for   "  free administration of justice  "   demanded under A , 5  .  The administration of criminal justice is to be had free everywhere ; that of civil justice is concerned almost exclusively with conflicts over property and hence affects almost exclusively the possessing classes  .  Are they to carry on their litigation at the expense of the national coffers  ?\
This paragraph on the schools should at least have demanded technical schools (  theoretical and practical  ) in combination with the elementary school  . \
  "  Elementary education by the state  "   is altogether objectionable  .  Defining by a general law the expenditures on the elementary schools , the qualifications of the teaching staff , the branches of instruction , etc  .  , and , as is done in the United States , supervising the fulfillment of these legal specifications by state inspectors , is a very different thing from appointing the state as the educator of the people  ! Government and church should rather be equally excluded from any influence on the school  .  Particularly , indeed , in the Prusso-German Empire (  and one should not take refuge in the rotten subterfuge that one is speaking of a   "  state of the future  "   ; we have seen how matters stand in this respect  ) the state has need , on the contrary , of a very stern education by the people  . \
But the whole program , for all its democratic clang , is tainted through and through by the Lassallean sect's servile belief in the state , or , what is no better , by a democratic belief in miracles ; or rather it is a compromise between these two kinds of belief in miracles , both equally remote from socialism  . \
  "  Freedom of science  "   says paragraph of the Prussian Constitution  .  Why , then , here  ?  . \
  "  Freedom of conscience  "    ! If one desired , at this time of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/k/u.htm#kulturkampf"}}{\fldrslt Kulturkampf}}\'a0to remind liberalism of its old catchwords , it surely could have been done only in the following form  : Everyone should be able to attend his religious as well as his bodily needs without the police sticking their noses in  .  But the Workers' party ought , at any rate in this connection , to have expressed its awareness of the fact that bourgeois   "  freedom of conscience  "   is nothing but the toleration of all possible kinds of religious freedom of conscience , and that for its part it endeavours rather to liberate the conscience from the witchery of religion  .  But one chooses not to transgress the   "  bourgeois  "   level  . \
I have now come to the end , for the appendix that now follows in the program does not constitute a characteristic component part of it  .  Hence , I can be very brief  . \

Modern Socialism is , in its essence , the direct product of the recognition , on the one hand , of the class antagonisms existing in the society of today between proprietors and non-proprietors , between capitalists and wage-workers ; on the other hand , of the anarchy existing in production  .  But , in its theoretical form , modern Socialism originally appears ostensibly as a more logical extension of the principles laid down by the great French philosophers of the 18th century  .  Like every new theory , modern Socialism had , at first , to connect itself with the intellectual stock-in-trade ready to its hand , however deeply its roots lay in material economic facts  . \
The great men , who in France prepared men\'92s minds for the coming revolution , were themselves extreme revolutionists  .  They recognized no external authority of any kind whatever  .  Religion , natural science , society , political institutions \'96 everything was subjected to the most unsparing criticism  : everything must justify its existence before the judgment-seat of reason or give up existence  .  Reason became the sole measure of everything  .  It was the time when , as Hegel says , the world stood upon its head\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}} ; first in the sense that the human head , and the principles arrived at by its thought , claimed to be the basis of all human action and association ; but by and by , also , in the wider sense that the reality which was in contradiction to these principles had , in fact , to be turned upside down  .  Every form of society and government then existing , every old traditional notion , was flung into the lumber-room as irrational ; the world had hitherto allowed itself to be led solely by prejudices ; everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt  .  Now , for the first time , appeared the light of day , the kingdom of reason ; henceforth superstition , injustice , privilege , oppression , were to be superseded by eternal truth , eternal Right , equality based on Nature and the inalienable rights of man  . \
We know today that this kingdom of reason was nothing more than the idealized kingdom of the bourgeoisie ; that this eternal Right found its realization in bourgeois justice ; that this equality reduced itself to bourgeois equality before the law ; that bourgeois property was proclaimed as one of the essential rights of man ; and that the government of reason , the\'a0Contrat Social\'a0of Rousseau , came into being , and only could come into being , as a democratic bourgeois republic  .  The great thinkers of the 18th century could , no more than their predecessors , go beyond the limits imposed upon them by their epoch  . \
But , side by side with the antagonisms of the feudal nobility and the burghers , who claimed to represent all the rest of society , was the general antagonism of exploiters and exploited , of rich idlers and poor workers  .  It was this very circumstance that made it possible for the representatives of the bourgeoisie to put themselves forward as representing not one special class , but the whole of suffering humanity  .  Still further  .  From its origin the bourgeoisie was saddled with its antithesis  : capitalists cannot exist without wage-workers , and , in the same proportion as the mediaeval burgher of the guild developed into the modern bourgeois , the guild journeyman and the day-laborer , outside the guilds , developed into the proletarian  .  And although , upon the whole , the bourgeoisie , in their struggle with the nobility , could claim to represent at the same time the interests of the different working-classes of that period , yet in every great bourgeois movement there were independent outbursts of that class which was the forerunner , more or less developed , of the modern proletariat  .  For example , at the time of the German Reformation and the Peasants\'92 War , the Anabaptists and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/m/u.htm#munzer"}}{\fldrslt Thomas M\'fcnzer}} ; in the great English Revolution , the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#levellers"}}{\fldrslt Levellers}} ; in the great French Revolution ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/b/a.htm#francois-babeuf"}}{\fldrslt Babeuf}}  . \
These were theoretical enunciations , corresponding with these revolutionary uprisings of a class not yet developed ; in the 16th and 17th centuries , Utopian pictures of ideal social conditions ; in the 18th century , actual communistic theories (  Morelly and Mably  ){\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt  [ 2 ]}}  .  The demand for equality was no longer limited to political rights ; it was extended also to the social conditions of individuals  .  It was not simply class privileges that were to be abolished , but class distinctions themselves  .  A Communism , ascetic , denouncing all the pleasures of life , Spartan , was the first form of the new teaching  .  Then came the three great Utopians  :\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/s/a.htm#saint-simon"}}{\fldrslt Saint-Simon}} , to whom the middle-class movement , side by side with the proletarian , still had a certain significance ;\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/f/o.htm#fourier"}}{\fldrslt Fourier}} ; and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/o/w.htm#owen"}}{\fldrslt Owen}} , who in the country where capitalist production was most developed , and under the influence of the antagonisms begotten of this , worked out his proposals for the removal of class distinction systematically and in direct relation to French materialism  . \
One thing is common to all three  .  Not one of them appears as a representative of the interests of that proletariat which historical development had , in the meantime , produced  .  Like the French philosophers , they do not claim to emancipate a particular class to begin with , but all humanity at once  .  Like them , they wish to bring in the kingdom of reason and eternal justice , but this kingdom , as they see it , is as far as Heaven from Earth , from that of the French philosophers  . \
For , to our three social reformers , the bourgeois world , based upon the principles of these philosophers , is quite as irrational and unjust , and , therefore , finds its way to the dust-hole quite as readily as feudalism and all the earlier stages of society  .  If pure reason and justice have not , hitherto , ruled the world , this has been the case only because men have not rightly understood them  .  What was wanted was the individual man of genius , who has now arisen and who understands the truth  .  That he has now arisen , that the truth has now been clearly understood , is not an inevitable event , following of necessity in the chains of historical development , but a mere happy accident  .  He might just as well have been born 500 years earlier , and might then have spared humanity 500 years of error , strife , and suffering  . \
We saw how the French philosophers of the 18th century , the forerunners of the Revolution , appealed to reason as the sole judge of all that is  .  A rational government , rational society , were to be founded ; everything that ran counter to eternal reason was to be remorselessly done away with  .  We saw also that this eternal reason was in reality nothing but the idealized understanding of the 18th century citizen , just then evolving into the bourgeois  .  The French Revolution had realized this rational society and government  . \
But the new order of things , rational enough as compared with earlier conditions , turned out to be by no means absolutely rational  .  The state based upon reason completely collapsed  .  Rousseau\'92s\'a0Contrat Social\'a0had found its realization in the Reign of Terror , from which the bourgeoisie , who had lost confidence in their own political capacity , had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate , and , finally , under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism  .  The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest  .  The society based upon reason had fared no better  .  The antagonism between rich and poor , instead of dissolving into general prosperity , had become intensified by the removal of the guild and other privileges , which had to some extent bridged it over , and by the removal of the charitable institutions of the Church  .  The \'93freedom of property\'94 from feudal fetters , now veritably accomplished , turned out to be , for the small capitalists and small proprietors , the freedom to sell their small property , crushed under the overmastering competition of the large capitalists and landlords , to these great lords , and thus , as far as the small capitalists and peasant proprietors were concerned , became \'93freedom\'a0from\'a0property\'94  .  The development of industry upon a capitalistic basis made poverty and misery of the working masses conditions of existence of society  .  Cash payment became more and more , in Carlyle\'92s phrase\'a0 [ See Thomas Carlyle ,\'a0Past and Present , London 1843 ] , the sole nexus between man and man  .  The number of crimes increased from year to year  .  Formerly , the feudal vices had openly stalked about in broad daylight ; though not eradicated , they were now at any rate thrust into the background  .  In their stead , the bourgeois vices , hitherto practiced in secret , began to blossom all the more luxuriantly  .  Trade became to a greater and greater extent cheating  .  The \'93fraternity\'94 of the revolutionary motto was realized in the chicanery and rivalries of the battle of competition  .  Oppression by force was replaced by corruption ; the sword , as the first social lever , by gold  .  The right of the first night was transferred from the feudal lords to the bourgeois manufacturers  .  Prostitution increased to an extent never heard of  .  Marriage itself remained , as before , the legally recognized form , the official cloak of prostitution , and , moreover , was supplemented by rich crops of adultery  . \
In a word , compared with the splendid promises of the philosophers , the social and political institutions born of the \'93triumph of reason\'94 were bitterly disappointing caricatures  .  All that was wanting was the men to formulate this disappointment , and they came with the turn of the century  .  In 1802 , Saint-Simon\'92s Geneva letters appeared ; in 1808 appeared Fourier\'92s first work , although the groundwork of his theory dated from 1799 ; on January 1 , 1800 , Robert Owen undertook the direction of New Lanark  . \
At this time , however , the capitalist mode of production , and with it the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat , was still very incompletely developed  .  Modern Industry , which had just arisen in England , was still unknown in France  .  But Modern Industry develops , on the one hand , the conflicts which make absolutely necessary a revolution in the mode of production , and the doing away with its capitalistic character \'96 conflicts not only between the classes begotten of it , but also between the very productive forces and the forms of exchange created by it  .  And , on the other hand , it develops , in these very gigantic productive forces , the means of ending these conflicts  .  If , therefore , about the year 1800 , the conflicts arising from the new social order were only just beginning to take shape , this holds still more fully as to the means of ending them  .  The \'93have-nothing\'94 masses of Paris , during the Reign of Terror , were able for a moment to gain the mastery , and thus to lead the bourgeois revolution to victory in spite of the bourgeoisie themselves  .  But , in doing so , they only proved how impossible it was for their domination to last under the conditions then obtaining  .  The proletariat , which then for the first time evolved itself from these \'93have-nothing\'94 masses as the nucleus of a new class , as yet quite incapable of independent political action , appeared as an oppressed , suffering order , to whom , in its incapacity to help itself , help could , at best , be brought in from without or down from above  . \
This historical situation also dominated the founders of Socialism  .  To the crude conditions of capitalistic production and the crude class conditions correspond crude theories  .  The solution of the social problems , which as yet lay hidden in undeveloped economic conditions , the Utopians attempted to evolve out of the human brain  .  Society presented nothing but wrongs ; to remove these was the task of reason  .  It was necessary , then , to discover a new and more perfect system of social order and to impose this upon society from without by propaganda , and , wherever it was possible , by the example of model experiments  .  These new social systems were foredoomed as Utopian ; the more completely they were worked out in detail , the more they could not avoid drifting off into pure phantasies  . \
These facts once established , we need not dwell a moment longer upon this side of the question , now wholly belonging to the past  .  We can leave it to the literary small fry to solemnly quibble over these phantasies , which today only make us smile , and to crow over the superiority of their own bald reasoning , as compared with such \'93insanity\'94  .  For ourselves , we delight in the stupendously grand thoughts and germs of thought that everywhere break out through their phantastic covering , and to which these Philistines are blind  . \
Saint-Simon was a son of the great French Revolution , at the outbreak of which he was not yet 30  .  The Revolution was the victory of the 3rd estate \'96 i  . e  .  , of the great masses of the nation ,\'a0working\'a0in production and in trade , over the privileged\'a0idle\'a0classes , the nobles and the priests  .  But the victory of the 3rd estate soon revealed itself as exclusively the victory of a smaller part of this \'93estate\'94 , as the conquest of political power by the socially privileged section of it \'96 i  . e  .  , the propertied bourgeoisie  .  And the bourgeoisie had certainly developed rapidly during the Revolution , partly by speculation in the lands of the nobility and of the Church , confiscated and afterwards put up for sale , and partly by frauds upon the nation by means of army contracts  .  It was the domination of these swindlers that , under the Directorate , brought France to the verge of ruin , and thus gave Napoleon the pretext for his\'a0coup d\'92\'e9tat  . \
Hence , to Saint-Simon the antagonism between the 3rd Estate and the privileged classes took the form of an antagonism between \'93workers\'94 and \'93idlers\'94  .  The idlers were not merely the old privileged classes , but also all who , without taking any part in production or distribution , lived on their incomes  .  And the workers were not only the wage-workers , but also the manufacturers , the merchants , the bankers  .  That the idlers had lost the capacity for intellectual leadership and political supremacy had been proved , and was by the Revolution finally settled  .  That the non-possessing classes had not this capacity seemed to Saint-Simon proved by the experiences of the Reign of Terror  .  Then , who was to lead and command  ? According to Saint-Simon , science and industry , both united by a new religious bond , destined to restore that unity of religious ideas which had been lost since the time of the Reformation \'96 a necessarily mystic and rigidly hierarchic \'93new Christianity\'94  .  But science , that was the scholars ; and industry , that was , in the first place , the working bourgeois , manufacturers , merchants , bankers  .  These bourgeois were , certainly , intended by Saint-Simon to transform themselves into a kind of public officials , of social trustees ; but they were still to hold ,\'a0vis-\'e0-vis\'a0of the workers , a commanding and economically privileged position  .  The bankers especially were to be called upon to direct the whole of social production by the regulation of credit  .  This conception was in exact keeping with a time in which Modern Industry in France and , with it , the chasm between bourgeoisie and proletariat was only just coming into existence  .  But what Saint-Simon especially lays stress upon is this  : what interests him first , and above all other things , is the lot of the class that is the most numerous and the most poor (  \'93la classe la plus nombreuse et la plus pauvre\'94  )  . \
Already in his Geneva letters , Saint-Simon lays down the proposition that \'93all men ought to work\'94  .  In the same work he recognizes also that the Reign of Terror was the reign of the non-possessing masses  . \
\'93See ,\'94 says he to them , \'93what happened in France at the time when your comrades held sway there ; they brought about a famine  . \'94\'a0 [ Lettres d\'92un habitant de Gen\'e8ve \'e0 ses contemporains , Saint-Simon , 1803 ]\
But to recognize the French Revolution as a class war , and not simply one between nobility and bourgeoisie , but between nobility , bourgeoisie , and the non-possessors , was , in the year 1802 , a most pregnant discovery  .  In 1816 , he declares that politics is the science of production , and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics  .  The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo  .  Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production \'96 that is to say , the \'93abolition of the state\'94 , about which recently there has been so much noise  . \
Saint-Simon shows the same superiority over his contemporaries , when in 1814 , immediately after the entry of the allies into Paris , and again in 1815 , during the Hundred Days\'92 War , he proclaims the alliance of France and England , and then of both of these countries , with Germany , as the only guarantee for the prosperous development and peace of Europe  .  To preach to the French in 1815 an alliance with the victors of Waterloo required as much courage as historical foresight  . \
If in Saint-Simon we find a comprehensive breadth of view , by virtue of which almost all the ideas of later Socialists that are not strictly economic are found in him in embryo , we find in Fourier a criticism of the existing conditions of society , genuinely French and witty , but not upon that account any the less thorough  .  Fourier takes the bourgeoisie , their inspired prophets before the Revolution , and their interested eulogists after it , at their own word  .  He lays bare remorselessly the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world  .  He confronts it with the earlier philosophers\'92 dazzling promises of a society in which reason alone should reign , of a civilization in which happiness should be universal , of an illimitable human perfectibility , and with the rose-colored phraseology of the bourgeois ideologists of his time  .  He points out how everywhere the most pitiful reality corresponds with the most high-sounding phrases , and he overwhelms this hopeless fiasco of phrases with his mordant sarcasm  . \
Fourier is not only a critic , his imperturbably serene nature makes him a satirist , and assuredly one of the greatest satirists of all time  .  He depicts , with equal power and charm , the swindling speculations that blossomed out upon the downfall of the Revolution , and the shopkeeping spirit prevalent in , and characteristic of , French commerce at that time  .  Still more masterly is his criticism of the bourgeois form of the relations between sexes , and the position of woman in bourgeois society  .  He was the first to declare that in any given society the degree of woman\'92s emancipation is the natural measure of the general emancipation  . \
But Fourier is at his greatest in his conception of the history of society  .  He divides its whole course , thus far , into four stages of evolution \'96 savagery , barbarism , the patriarchate , civilization  .  This last is identical with the so-called civil , or bourgeois , society of today \'96 i  . e  .  , with the social order that came in with the 16th century  .  He proves \'93that the civilized stage raises every vice practiced by barbarism in a simple fashion into a form of existence , complex , ambiguous , equivocal , hypocritical\'94 \'96 that civilization moves \'93in a vicious circle\'94 , in contradictions which it constantly reproduces without being able to solve them ; hence it constantly arrives at the very opposite to that which it wants to attain , or pretends to want to attain , so that , e  . g  .  , \'93under civilization poverty is born of superabundance itself\'94  . \'a0 [ Th\'e9orie de l\'92unite universelle , Fourier , 1843 and\'a0Le nouveau monde industriel et soci\'e9taire , ou invention du proc\'e9d\'e9 d'industrie attrayante et enaturelle distribu\'e9e en s\'e9ries passionn\'e9es , Fourier , 1845 ]\
Fourier , as we see , uses the dialectic method in the same masterly way as his contemporary , Hegel  .  Using these same dialectics , he argues against talk about illimitable human perfectibility , that every historical phase has its period of ascent and also its period of descent , and he applies this observation to the future of the whole human race  .  As Kant introduced into natural science the idea of the ultimate destruction of the Earth , Fourier introduced into historical science that of the ultimate destruction of the human race  . \
Whilst in France the hurricane of the Revolution swept over the land , in England a quieter , but not on that account less tremendous , revolution was going on  .  Steam and the new tool-making machinery were transforming manufacture into modern industry , and thus revolutionizing the whole foundation of bourgeois society  .  The sluggish march of development of the manufacturing period changed into a veritable storm and stress period of production  .  With constantly increasing swiftness the splitting-up into large capitalists and non-possessing proletarians went on  .  Between these , instead of the former stable middle-class , an unstable mass of artisans and small shopkeepers , the most fluctuating portion of the population , now led a precarious existence  . \
The new mode of production was , as yet , only at the beginning of its period of ascent ; as yet it was the normal , regular method of production \'96 the only one possible under existing conditions  .  Nevertheless , even then it was producing crying social abuses \'96 the herding together of a homeless population in the worst quarters of the large towns ; the loosening of all traditional moral bonds , of patriarchal subordination , of family relations ; overwork , especially of women and children , to a frightful extent ; complete demoralization of the working-class , suddenly flung into altogether new conditions , from the country into the town , from agriculture into modern industry , from stable conditions of existence into insecure ones that change from day to day  . \
At this juncture , there came forward as a reformer a manufacturer 29-years-old \'96 a man of almost sublime , childlike simplicity of character , and at the same time one of the few born leaders of men  .  Robert Owen had adopted the teaching of the materialistic philosophers  : that man\'92s character is the product , on the one hand , of heredity ; on the other , of the environment of the individual during his lifetime , and especially during his period of development  .  In the industrial revolution most of his class saw only chaos and confusion , and the opportunity of fishing in these troubled waters and making large fortunes quickly  .  He saw in it the opportunity of putting into practice his favorite theory , and so of bringing order out of chaos  .  He had already tried it with success , as superintendent of more than 500 men in a Manchester factory  .  From 1800 to 1829 , he directed the great cotton mill at New Lanark , in Scotland , as managing partner , along the same lines , but with greater freedom of action and with a success that made him a European reputation  .  A population , originally consisting of the most diverse and , for the most part , very demoralized elements , a population that gradually grew to 2 ,500 , he turned into a model colony , in which drunkenness , police , magistrates , lawsuits , poor laws , charity , were unknown  .  And all this simply by placing the people in conditions worthy of human beings , and especially by carefully bringing up the rising generation  .  He was the founder of infant schools , and introduced them first at New Lanark  .  At the age of two , the children came to school , where they enjoyed themselves so much that they could scarely be got home again  .  Whilst his competitors worked their people 13 or 14 hours a day , in New Lanark the working-day was only 10 and a half hours  .  When a crisis in cotton stopped work for four months , his workers received their full wages all the time  .  And with all this the business more than doubled in value , and to the last yielded large profits to its proprietors  . \
In spite of all this , Owen was not content  .  The existence which he secured for his workers was , in his eyes , still far from being worthy of human beings  .    "  The people were slaves at my mercy  .   "   The relatively favorable conditions in which he had placed them were still far from allowing a rational development of the character and of the intellect in all directions , much less of the free exercise of all their faculties  . \
\'93And yet , the working part of this population of 2 ,500 persons was daily producing as much real wealth for society as , less than half a century before , it would have required the working part of a population of 600 ,000 to create  .  I asked myself , what became of the difference between the wealth consumed by 2 ,500 persons and that which would have been consumed by 600 ,000  ?\'94\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm#3"}}{\fldrslt  [ 3 ]}}\
The answer was clear  .  It had been used to pay the proprietors of the establishment 5 per cent on the capital they had laid out , in addition to over \'a3300 ,000 clear profit  .  And that which held for New Lanark held to a still greater extent for all the factories in England  . \
\'93If this new wealth had not been created by machinery , imperfectly as it has been applied , the wars of Europe , in opposition to Napoleon , and to support the aristocratic principles of society , could not have been maintained  .  And yet this new power was the creation of the working-classes  . \'94\
Note , l  .  c  .  , p  . 22  . \
To them , therefore , the fruits of this new power belonged  .  The newly-created gigantic productive forces , hitherto used only to enrich individuals and to enslave the masses , offered to Owen the foundations for a reconstruction of society ; they were destined , as the common property of all , to be worked for the common good of all  . \
Owen\'92s communism was based upon this purely business foundation , the outcome , so to say , of commercial calculation  .  Throughout , it maintained this practical character  .  Thus , in 1823 , Owen proposed the relief of the distress in Ireland by Communist colonies , and drew up complete estimates of costs of founding them , yearly expenditure , and probable revenue  .  And in his definite plan for the future , the technical working out of details is managed with such practical knowledge \'96 ground plan , front and side and bird\'92s-eye views all included \'96 that the Owen method of social reform once accepted , there is from the practical point of view little to be said against the actual arrangement of details  . \
His advance in the direction of Communism was the turning-point in Owen\'92s life  .  As long as he was simply a philanthropist , he was rewarded with nothing but wealth , applause , honor , and glory  .  He was the most popular man in Europe  .  Not only men of his own class , but statesmen and princes listened to him approvingly  .  But when he came out with his Communist theories that was quite another thing  .  Three great obstacles seemed to him especially to block the path to social reform  : private property , religion , the present form of marriage  . \
He knew what confronted him if he attacked these \'96 outlawry , excommunication from official society , the loss of his whole social position  .  But nothing of this prevented him from attacking them without fear of consequences , and what he had foreseen happened  .  Banished from official society , with a conspiracy of silence against him in the press , ruined by his unsuccessful Communist experiments in America , in which he sacrificed all his fortune , he turned directly to the working-class and continued working in their midst for 30 years  .  Every social movement , every real advance in England on behalf of the workers links itself on to the name of Robert Owen  .  He forced through in 1819 , after five years\'92 fighting , the first law limiting the hours of labor of women and children in factories  .  He was president of the first Congress at which all the Trade Unions of England united in a single great trade association  .  He introduced as transition measures to the complete communistic organization of society , on the one hand , cooperative societies for retail trade and production  .  These have since that time , at least , given practical proof that the merchant and the manufacturer are socially quite unnecessary  .  On the other hand , he introduced labor bazaars for the exchange of the products of labor through the medium of labor-notes , whose unit was a single hour of work ; institutions necessarily doomed to failure , but completely anticipating Proudhon\'92s bank of exchange of a much later period , and differing entirely from this in that it did not claim to be the panacea for all social ills , but only a first step towards a much more radical revolution of society  . \
The Utopians\'92 mode of thought has for a long time governed the Socialist ideas of the 19th century , and still governs some of them  .  Until very recently , all French and English Socialists did homage to it  .  The earlier German Communism , including that of Weitling , was of the same school  .  To all these , Socialism is the expression of absolute truth , reason and justice , and has only to be discovered to conquer all the world by virtue of its own power  .  And as an absolute truth is independent of time , space , and of the historical development of man , it is a mere accident when and where it is discovered  .  With all this , absolute truth , reason , and justice are different with the founder of each different school  .  And as each one\'92s special kind of absolute truth , reason , and justice is again conditioned by his subjective understanding , his conditions of existence , the measure of his knowledge and his intellectual training , there is no other ending possible in this conflict of absolute truths than that they shall be mutually exclusive of one another  .  Hence , from this nothing could come but a kind of eclectic , average Socialism , which , as a matter of fact , has up to the present time dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in France and England  .  Hence , a mish-mash allowing of the most manifold shades of opinion  : a mish-mash of such critical statements , economic theories , pictures of future society by the founders of different sects , as excite a minimum of opposition ; a mish-mash which is the more easily brewed the more definite sharp edges of the individual constituents are rubbed down in the stream of debate , like rounded pebbles in a brook  . \
To make a science of Socialism , it had first to be placed upon a real basis  . \
In the meantime , along with and after the French philosophy of the 18th century , had arisen the new German philosophy , culminating in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#hegel"}}{\fldrslt Hegel}}  . \
Its greatest merit was the taking up again of dialectics as the highest form of reasoning  .  The old Greek philosophers were all born natural dialecticians , and Aristotle , the most encyclopaedic of them , had already analyzed the most essential forms of dialectic thought  .  The newer philosophy , on the other hand , although in it also dialectics had brilliant exponents (  e  . g  .  Descartes and Spinoza  ) , had , especially through English influence , become more and more rigidly fixed in the so-called metaphysical mode of reasoning , by which also the French of the 18th century were almost wholly dominated , at all events in their special philosophical work  .  Outside philosophy in the restricted sense , the French nevertheless produced masterpieces of dialectic  .  We need only call to mind Diderot's\'a0Le Neveu de Rameau , and Rousseau's\'a0Discours sur l'origine et les fondements de l'inegalite parmi less hommes  .  We give here , in brief , the essential character of these two modes of thought  . \
When we consider and reflect upon Nature at large , or the history of mankind , or our own intellectual activity , at first we see the picture of an endless entanglement of relations and reactions , permutations and combinations , in which nothing remains what , where and as it was , but everything moves , changes , comes into being and passes away  .  We see , therefore , at first the picture as a whole , with its individual parts still more or less kept in the background ; we observe the movements , transitions , connections , rather than the things that move , combine , and are connected  .  This primitive , naive but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek philosophy , and was first clearly formulated by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/e.htm#heraclitus"}}{\fldrslt Heraclitus}}  : everything is and is not , for everything is fluid , is constantly changing , constantly coming into being and passing away  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\
But this conception , correctly as it expresses the general character of the picture of appearances as a whole , does not suffice to explain the details of which this picture is made up , and so long as we do not understand these , we have not a clear idea of the whole picture  .  In order to understand these details , we must detach them from their natural , special causes , effects , etc  .  This is , primarily , the task of natural science and historical research  : branches of science which the Greek of classical times , on very good grounds , relegated to a subordinate position , because they had first of all to collect materials for these sciences to work upon  .  A certain amount of natural and historical material must be collected before there can be any critical analysis , comparison , and arrangement in classes , orders , and species  .  The foundations of the exact natural sciences were , therefore , first worked out by the Greeks of the Alexandrian period\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}} , and later on , in the Middle Ages , by the Arabs  .  Real natural science dates from the second half of the 15th century , and thence onward it had advanced with constantly increasing rapidity  .  The analysis of Nature into its individual parts , the grouping of the different natural processes and objects in definite classes , the study of the internal anatomy of organized bodies in their manifold forms \'97 these were the fundamental conditions of the gigantic strides in our knowledge of Nature that have been made during the last 400 years  .  But this method of work has also left us as legacy the habit of observing natural objects and processes in isolation , apart from their connection with the vast whole ; of observing them in repose , not in motion ; as constraints , not as essentially variables ; in their death , not in their life  .  And when this way of looking at things was transferred by Bacon and Locke from natural science to philosophy , it begot the narrow , metaphysical mode of thought peculiar to the last century  . \
To the metaphysician , things and their mental reflexes , ideas , are isolated , are to be considered one after the other and apart from each other , are objects of investigation fixed , rigid , given once for all  .  He thinks in absolutely irreconcilable antitheses  .  His communication is 'yea , yea ; nay , nay' ; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil  .   "   For him , a thing either exists or does not exist ; a thing cannot at the same time be itself and something else  .  Positive and negative absolutely exclude one another ; cause and effect stand in a rigid antithesis , one to the other  . \
At first sight , this mode of thinking seems to us very luminous , because it is that of so-called sound commonsense  .  Only sound commonsense , respectable fellow that he is , in the homely realm of his own four walls , has very wonderful adventures directly he ventures out into the wide world of research  .  And the metaphysical mode of thought , justifiable and necessary as it is in a number of domains whose extent varies according to the nature of the particular object of investigation , sooner or later reaches a limit , beyond which it becomes one-sided , restricted , abstract , lost in insoluble contradictions  .  In the contemplation of individual things , it forgets the connection between them ; in the contemplation of their existence , it forgets the beginning and end of that existence ; of their repose , it forgets their motion  .  It cannot see the woods for the trees  . \
For everyday purposes , we know and can say , e  . g  .  , whether an animal is alive or not  .  But , upon closer inquiry , we find that his is , in many cases , a very complex question , as the jurists know very well  .  They have cudgelled their brains in vain to discover a rational limit beyond which the killing of the child in its mother's womb is murder  .  It is just as impossible to determine absolutely the moment of death , for physiology proves that death is not an instantaneous , momentary phenomenon , but a very protracted process  . \
In like manner , every organized being is every moment the same and not the same ; every moment , it assimilates matter supplied from without , and gets rid of other matter ; every moment , some cells of its body die and others build themselves anew ; in a longer or shorter time , the matter of its body is completely renewed , and is replaced by other molecules of matter , so that every organized being is always itself , and yet something other than itself  . \
Further , we find upon closer investigation that the two poles of an antithesis , positive and negative , e  . g  .  , are as inseparable as they are opposed , and that despite all their opposition , they mutually interpenetrate  .  And we find , in like manner , that cause and effect are conceptions which only hold good in their application to individual cases ; but as soon as we consider the individual cases in their general connection with the universe as a whole , they run into each other , and they become confounded when we contemplate that universal action and reaction in which causes and effects are eternally changing places , so that what is effect here and now will be cause there and then , and vice versa  . \
None of these processes and modes of thought enters into the framework of metaphysical reasoning  .  Dialectics , on the other hand , comprehends things and their representations , ideas , in their essential connection , concatenation , motion , origin and ending  .  Such processes as those mentioned above are , therefore , so many corroborations of its own method of procedure  . \
Nature is the proof of dialectics , and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasingly daily , and thus has shown that , in the last resort , Nature works dialectically and not metaphysically ; that she does not move in the eternal oneness of a perpetually recurring circle , but goes through a real historical evolution  .  In this connection , Darwin must be named before all others  .  He dealt the metaphysical conception of Nature the heaviest blow by his proof that all organic beings , plants , animals , and man himself , are the products of a process of evolution going on through millions of years  .  But , the naturalists , who have learned to think dialectically , are few and far between , and this conflict of the results of discovery with preconceived modes of thinking , explains the endless confusion now reigning in theoretical natural science , the despair of teachers as well as learners , of authors and readers alike  . \
An exact representation of the universe , of its evolution , of the development of mankind , and of the reflection of this evolution in the minds of men , can therefore only be obtained by the methods of dialectics with its constant regard to the innumerable actions and reactions of life and death , of progressive or retrogressive changes  .  And in this spirit , the new German philosophy has worked  .  Kant began his career by resolving the stable Solar system of Newton and its eternal duration , after the famous initial impulse had once been given , into the result of a historical process , the formation of the Sun and all the planets out of a rotating , nebulous mass  .  From this , he at the same time drew the conclusion that , given this origin of the Solar system , its future death followed of necessity  .  His theory , half a century later , was established mathematically by Laplace , and half a century after that , the spectroscope proved the existence in space of such incandescent masses of gas in various stages of condensation  . \
This new German philosophy culminated in the Hegelian system  .  In this system \'97 and herein is its great merit \'97 for the first time the whole world , natural , historical , intellectual , is represented as a process \'97 i  . e  .  , as in constant motion , change , transformation , development ; and the attempt is made to trace out the internal connection that makes a continuous whole of all this movement and development  .  From this point of view , the history of mankind no longer appeared as a wild whirl of senseless deeds of violence , all equally condemnable at the judgment seat of mature philosophic reason and which are best forgotten as quickly as possible , but as the process of evolution of man himself  .  It was now the task of the intellect to follow the gradual march of this process through all its devious ways , and to trace out the inner law running through all its apparently accidental phenomena  . \
That the Hegelian system did not solve the problem it propounded is here immaterial  .  Its epoch-making merit was that it propounded the problem  .  This problem is one that no single individual will ever be able to solve  .  Although Hegel was \'97 with Saint-Simon \'97 the most encyclopaedic mind of his time , yet he was limited , first , by the necessary limited extent of his own knowledge and , second , by the limited extent and depth of the knowledge and conceptions of his age  .  To these limits , a third must be added ; Hegel was an idealist  .  To him , the thoughts within his brain were not the more or less abstract pictures of actual things and processes , but , conversely , things and their evolution were only the realized pictures of the   "  Idea  "   , existing somewhere from eternity before the world was  .  This way of thinking turned everything upside down , and completely reversed the actual connection of things in the world  .  Correctly and ingeniously as many groups of facts were grasped by Hegel , yet , for the reasons just given , there is much that is botched , artificial , labored , in a word , wrong in point of detail  .  The Hegelian system , in itself , was a colossal miscarriage \'97 but it was also the last of its kind  . \
It was suffering , in fact , from an internal and incurable contradiction  .  Upon the one hand , its essential proposition was the conception that human history is a process of evolution , which , by its very nature , cannot find its intellectual final term in the discovery of any so-called absolute truth  .  But , on the other hand , it laid claim to being the very essence of this absolute truth  .  A system of natural and historical knowledge , embracing everything , and final for all time , is a contradiction to the fundamental law of dialectic reasoning  . \
This law , indeed , by no means excludes , but , on the contrary , includes the idea that the systematic knowledge of the external universe can make giant strides from age to age  . \
The perception of the the fundamental contradiction in German idealism led necessarily back to materialism , but \'97\'a0nota bene\'a0\'97 not to the simply metaphysical , exclusively mechanical materialism of the 18th century  .  Old materialism looked upon all previous history as a crude heap of irrationality and violence ; modern materialism sees in it the process of evolution of humanity , and aims at discovering the laws thereof  .  With the French of the 18th century , and even with Hegel , the conception obtained of Nature as a whole \'97 moving in narrow circles , and forever immutable , with its eternal celestial bodies , as Newton , and unalterable organic species , as Linnaeus , taught  .  Modern materialism embraces the more recent discoveries of natural science , according to which Nature also has its history in time , the celestial bodies , like the organic species that , under favorable conditions , people them , being born and perishing  .  And even if Nature , as a whole , must still be said to move in recurrent cycles , these cycles assume infinitely larger dimensions  .  In both aspects , modern materialism is essentially dialectic , and no longer requires the assistance of that sort of philosophy which , queen-like , pretended to rule the remaining mob of sciences  .  As soon as each special science is bound to make clear its position in the great totality of things and of our knowledge of things , a special science dealing with this totality is superfluous or unnecessary  .  That which still survives of all earlier philosophy is the science of thought and its law \'97 formal logic and dialectics  .  Everything else is subsumed in the positive science of Nature and history  . \
Whilst , however , the revolution in the conception of Nature could only be made in proportion to the corresponding positive materials furnished by research , already much earlier certain historical facts had occurred which led to a decisive change in the conception of history  .  In 1831 , the first working-class rising took place in Lyons ; between 1838 and 1842 , the first national working-class movement , that of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/c/h.htm#chartists"}}{\fldrslt English Chartists}} , reached its height  .  The class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie came to the front in the history of the most advanced countries in Europe , in proportion to the development , upon the one hand , of modern industry , upon the other , of the newly-acquired political supremacy of the bourgeoisie  .  facts more and more strenuously gave the lie to the teachings of bourgeois economy as to the identity of the interests of capital and labor , as to the universal harmony and universal prosperity that would be the consequence of unbridled competition  .  All these things could no longer be ignored , any more than the French and English Socialism , which was their theoretical , though very imperfect , expression  .  But the old idealist conception of history , which was not yet dislodged , knew nothing of class struggles based upon economic interests , knew nothing of economic interests ; production and all economic relations appeared in it only as incidental , subordinate elements in the   "  history of civilization  "    . \
The new facts made imperative a new examination of all past history  .  Then it was seen that\'a0all\'a0past history , with the exception of its primitive stages , was the history of class struggles ; that these warring classes of society are always the products of the modes of production and of exchange \'97 in a word , of the\'a0economic\'a0conditions of their time ; that the economic structure of society always furnishes the real basis , starting from which we can alone work out the ultimate explanation of the whole superstructure of juridical and political institutions as well as of the religious , philosophical , and other ideas of a given historical period  .  Hegel has freed history from metaphysics \'97 he made it dialectic ; but his conception of history was essentially idealistic  .  But now idealism was driven from its last refuge , the philosophy of history ; now a materialistic treatment of history was propounded , and a method found of explaining man's   "  knowing  "   by his   "  being  "   , instead of , as heretofore , his   "  being  "   by his   "  knowing  "    . \
From that time forward , Socialism was no longer an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain , but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes \'97 the proletariat and the bourgeoisie  .  Its task was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible , but to examine the historico-economic succession of events from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung , and to discover in the economic conditions thus created the means of ending the conflict  .  But the Socialism of earlier days was as incompatible with this materialist conception as the conception of Nature of the French materialists was with dialectics and modern natural science  .  The Socialism of earlier days certainly criticized the existing capitalistic mode of production and its consequences  .  But it could not explain them , and , therefore , could not get the mastery of them  .  It could only simply reject them as bad  .  The more strongly this earlier Socialism denounced the exploitations of the working-class , inevitable under Capitalism , the less able was it clearly to show in what this exploitation consisted and how it arose  .  but for this it was necessary \'97\
to present the capitalistic mode of production in its historical connection and its inevitableness during a particular historical period , and therefore , also , to present its inevitable downfall ; and\
to lay bare its essential character , which was still a secret  .  This was done by the discovery of\'a0surplus-value  . \
It was shown that the appropriation of unpaid labor is the basis of the capitalist mode of production and of the exploitation of the worker that occurs under it ; that even if the capitalist buys the labor power of his laborer at its full value as a commodity on the market , he yet extracts more value from it than he paid for ; and that in the ultimate analysis , this surplus-value forms those sums of value from which are heaped up constantly increasing masses of capital in the hands of the possessing classes  .  The genesis of capitalist production and the production of capital were both explained  . \
These two great discoveries , the materialistic conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus-value , we owe to Marx  .  With these discoveries , Socialism became a science  .  The next thing was to work out all its details and relations  . \
The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and , next to production , the exchange of things produced , is the basis of all social structure ; that in every society that has appeared in history , the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced , how it is produced , and how the products are exchanged  .  From this point of view , the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought , not in men's brains , not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice , but in changes in the modes of production and exchange  .  They are to be sought , not in the\'a0philosophy , but in the\'a0economics\'a0of each particular epoch  .  The growing perception that existing social institutions are unreasonable and unjust , that reason has become unreason , and right wrong\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt  [ 1 ]}} , is only proof that in the modes of production and exchange changes have silently taken place with which the social order , adapted to earlier economic conditions , is no longer in keeping  .  From this it also follows that the means of getting rid of the incongruities that have been brought to light must also be present , in a more or less developed condition , within the changed modes of production themselves  .  These means are not to be invented by deduction from fundamental principles , but are to be discovered in the stubborn facts of the existing system of production  . \
What is , then , the position of modern Socialism in this connection  ?\
The present situation of society \'97 this is now pretty generally conceded \'97 is the creation of the ruling class of today , of the bourgeoisie  .  The mode of production peculiar to the bourgeoisie , known , since Marx , as the capitalist mode of production , was incompatible with the feudal system , with the privileges it conferred upon individuals , entire social ranks and local corporations , as well as with the hereditary ties of subordination which constituted the framework of its social organization  .  The bourgeoisie broke up the feudal system and built upon its ruins the capitalist order of society , the kingdom of free competition , of personal liberty , of the equality , before the law , of all commodity owners , of all the rest of the capitalist blessings  .  Thenceforward , the capitalist mode of production could develop in freedom  .  Since steam , machinery , and the making of machines by machinery transformed the older manufacture into modern industry , the productive forces , evolved under the guidance of the bourgeoisie , developed with a rapidity and in a degree unheard of before  .  But just as the older manufacture , in its time , and handicraft , becoming more developed under its influence , had come into collision with the feudal trammels of the guilds , so now modern industry , in its complete development , comes into collision with the bounds within which the capitalist mode of production holds it confined  .  The new productive forces have already outgrown the capitalistic mode of using them  .  And this conflict between productive forces and modes of production is not a conflict engendered in the mind of man , like that between original sin and divine justice  .  It exists , in fact , objectively , outside us , independently of the will and actions even of the men that have brought it on  .  Modern Socialism is nothing but the reflex , in thought , of this conflict in fact ; its ideal reflection in the minds , first , of the class directly suffering under it , the working class  . \
Now , in what does this conflict consist  ?\
Before capitalist production \'97 i  . e  .  , in the Middle Ages \'97 the system of petty industry obtained generally , based upon the private property of the laborers in their means of production ; in the country , the agriculture of the small peasant , freeman , or serf ; in the towns , the handicrafts organized in guilds  .  The instruments of labor \'97 land , agricultural implements , the workshop , the tool \'97 were the instruments of labor of single individuals , adapted for the use of one worker , and , therefore , of necessity , small , dwarfish , circumscribed  .  But , for this very reason , they belonged as a rule to the producer himself  .  To concentrate these scattered , limited means of production , to enlarge them , to turn them into the powerful levers of production of the present day \'97 this was precisely the historic role of capitalist production and of its upholder , the bourgeoisie  .  In the fourth section of\'a0Capital , Marx has explained in detail how since the 15th century this has been historically worked out through the three phases of simple co-operation , manufacture , and modern industry  .  But the bourgeoisie , as is shown there , could not transform these puny means of production into mighty productive forces without transforming them , at the same time , from means of production of the individual into\'a0social\'a0means of production only workable by a collectivity of men  .  The spinning wheel , the handloom , the blacksmith's hammer , were replaced by the spinning-machine , the power-loom , the steam-hammer ; the individual workshop , by the factory implying the co-operation of hundreds and thousands of workmen  .  In like manner , production itself changed from a series of individual into a series of social acts , and the production from individual to social products  .  The yarn , the cloth , the metal articles that now come out of the factory were the joint product of many workers , through whose hands they had successively to pass before they were ready  .  No one person could say of them  :   "  I made that ; this is\'a0my\'a0product  .   "  \
But where , in a given society , the fundamental form of production is that spontaneous division of labor which creeps in gradually and not upon any preconceived plan , there the products take on the form of\'a0commodities , whose mutual exchange , buying and selling , enable the individual producers to satisfy their manifold wants  .  And this was the case in the Middle Ages  .  The peasant , e  . g  .  , sold to the artisan agricultural products and bought from him the products of handicraft  .  Into this society of individual producers , of commodity producers , the new mode of production thrust itself  .  In the midst of the old division of labor , grown up spontaneously and upon\'a0no definite plan , which had governed the whole of society , now arose division of labor upon\'a0a definite plan , as organized in the factory ; side by side with\'a0individualproduction appeared\'a0social\'a0production  .  The products of both were sold in the same market , and , therefore , at prices at least approximately equal  .  But organization upon a definite plan was stronger than spontaneous division of labor  .  The factories working with the combined social forces of a collectivity of individuals produced their commodities far more cheaply than the individual small producers  .  Individual producers succumbed in one department after another  .  Socialized production revolutionized all the old methods of production  .  But its revolutionary character was , at the same time , so little recognized that it was , on the contrary , introduced as a means of increasing and developing the production of commodities  .  When it arose , it found ready-made , and made liberal use of , certain machinery for the production and exchange of commodities  : merchants' capital , handicraft , wage-labor  .  Socialized production thus introducing itself as a new form of the production of commodities , it was a matter of course that under it the old forms of appropriation remained in full swing , and were applied to its products as well  . \
In the medieval stage of evolution of the production of commodities , the question as to the owner of the product of labor could not arise  .  The individual producer , as a rule , had , from raw material belonging to himself , and generally his own handiwork , produced it with his own tools , by the labor of his own hands or of his family  .  There was no need for him to appropriate the new product  .  It belonged wholly to him , as a matter of course  .  His property in the product was , therefore , based\'a0upon his own labor  .  Even where external help was used , this was , as a rule , of little importance , and very generally was compensated by something other than wages  .  The apprentices and journeymen of the guilds worked less for board and wages than for education , in order that they might become master craftsmen themselves  . \
Then came the concentration of the means of production and of the producers in large workshops and manufactories , their transformation into actual socialized means of production and socialized producers  .  But the socialized producers and means of production and their products were still treated , after this change , just as they had been before \'97 i  . e  .  , as the means of production and the products of individuals  .  Hitherto , the owner of the instruments of labor had himself appropriated the product , because , as a rule , it was his own product and the assistance of others was the exception  .  Now , the owner of the instruments of labor always appropriated to himself the product , although it was no longer\'a0his\'a0product but exclusively the product of the\'a0labor of others  .  Thus , the products now produced socially were not appropriated by those who had actually set in motion the means of production and actually produced the commodities , but by the\'a0capitalists  .  The means of production , and production itself , had become in essence socialized  .  But they were subjected to a form of appropriation which presupposes the private production of individuals , under which , therefore , every one owns his own product and brings it to market  .  The mode of production is subjected to this form of appropriation , although it abolishes the conditions upon which the latter rests  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt  [ 2 ]}}\
This contradiction , which gives to the new mode of production its capitalistic character ,\'a0contains the germ of the whole of the social antagonisms of today  .  The greater the mastery obtained by the new mode of production over all important fields of production and in all manufacturing countries , the more it reduced individual production to an insignificant residuum ,\'a0the more clearly was brought out the incompatibility of socialized production with capitalistic appropriation  . \
The first capitalists found , as we have said , alongside of other forms of labor , wage-labor ready-made for them on the market  .  But it was exceptional , complementary , accessory , transitory wage-labor  .  The agricultural laborer , though , upon occasion , he hired himself out by the day , had a few acres of his own land on which he could at all events live at a pinch  .  The guilds were so organized that the journeyman of today became the master of tomorrow  .  But all this changed , as soon as the means of production became socialized and concentrated in the hands of capitalists  .  The means of production , as well as the product , of the individual producer became more and more worthless ; there was nothing left for him but to turn wage-worker under the capitalist  .  Wage-labor , aforetime the exception and accessory , now became the rule and basis of all production ; aforetime complementary , it now became the sole remaining function of the worker  .  The wage-worker for a time became a wage-worker for life  .  The number of these permanent was further enormously increased by the breaking-up of the feudal system that occurred at the same time , by the disbanding of the retainers of the feudal lords , the eviction of the peasants from their homesteads , etc  .  The separation was made complete between the means of production concentrated in the hands of the capitalists , on the one side , and the producers , possessing nothing but their labor-power , on the other  . \'a0The contradiction between socialized production and capitalistic appropriation manifested itself as the antagonism of proletariat and bourgeoisie  . \
We have seen that the capitalistic mode of production thrust its way into a society of commodity-producers , of individual producers , whose social bond was the exchange of their products  .  But every society based upon the production of commodities has this peculiarity  : that the producers have lost control over their own social inter-relations  .  Each man produces for himself with such means of production as he may happen to have , and for such exchange as he may require to satisfy his remaining wants  .  No one knows how much of his particular article is coming on the market , nor how much of it will be wanted  .  No one knows whether his individual product will meet an actual demand , whether he will be able to make good his costs of production or even to sell his commodity at all  .  Anarchy reigns in socialized production  . \
But the production of commodities , like every other form of production , has it peculiar , inherent laws inseparable from it ; and these laws work , despite anarchy , in and through anarchy  .  They reveal themselves in the only persistent form of social inter-relations \'97 i  . e  .  , in exchange \'97 and here they affect the individual producers as compulsory laws of competition  .  They are , at first , unknown to these producers themselves , and have to be discovered by them gradually and as the result of experience  .  They work themselves out , therefore , independently of the producers , and in antagonism to them , as inexorable natural laws of their particular form of production  .  The product governs the producers  . \
In mediaeval society , especially in the earlier centuries , production was essentially directed toward satisfying the wants of the individual  .  It satisfied , in the main , only the wants of the producer and his family  .  Where relations of personal dependence existed , as in the country , it also helped to satisfy the wants of the feudal lord  .  In all this there was , therefore , no exchange ; the products , consequently , did not assume the character of commodities  .  The family of the peasant produced almost everything they wanted  : clothes and furniture , as well as the means of subsistence  .  Only when it began to produce more than was sufficient to supply its own wants and the payments in kind to the feudal lords , only then did it also produce commodities  .  This surplus , thrown into socialized exchange and offered for sale , became commodities  . \
The artisan in the towns , it is true , had from the first to produce for exchange  .  But they , also , themselves supplied the greatest part of their individual wants  .  They had gardens and plots of land  .  They turned their cattle out into the communal forest , which , also , yielded them timber and firing  .  The women spun flax , wool , and so forth  .  Production for the purpose of exchange , production of commodities , was only in its infancy  .  Hence , exchange was restricted , the market narrow , the methods of production stable ; there was local exclusiveness without , local unity within ; the mark in the country ; in the town , the guild  . \
But with the extension of the production of commodities , and especially with the introduction of the capitalist mode of production , the laws of commodity-production , hitherto latent , came into action more openly and with greater force  .  The old bonds were loosened , the old exclusive limits broken through , the producers were more and more turned into independent , isolated producers of commodities  .  It became apparent that the production of society at large was ruled by absence of plan , by accident , by anarchy ; and this anarchy grew to greater and greater height  .  But the chief means by aid of which the capitalist mode of production intensified this anarchy of socialized production was the exact opposite of anarchy  .  It was the increasing organization of production , upon a social basis , in every individual productive establishment  .  By this , the old , peaceful , stable condition of things was ended  .  Wherever this organization of production was introduced into a branch of industry , it brooked no other method of production by its side  .  The field of labor became a battle-ground  .  The great geographical discoveries , and the colonization following them , multiplied markets and quickened the transformation of handicraft into manufacture  .  The war did not simply break out between the individual producers of particular localities  .  The local struggles begat , in their turn , national conflicts , the commercial wars of the 17th and 18th centuries  . \
Finally , modern industry and the opening of the world-market made the struggle universal , and at the same time gave it an unheard-of virulence  .  Advantages in natural or artificial conditions of production now decide the existence or non-existence of individual capitalists , as well as of whole industries and countries  .  He that falls is remorselessly cast aside  .  It is the Darwinian struggle of the individual for existence transferred from Nature to society with intensified violence  .  The conditions of existence natural to the animal appear as the final term of human development  .  The contradiction between socialized production and capitalistic appropriation now presents itself as\'a0an antagonism between the organization of production in the individual workshop and the anarchy of production in society generally  . \
The capitalistic mode of production moves in these two forms of the antagonism immanent to it from its very origin  .  It is never able to get out of that   "  vicious circle  "   which Fourier had already discovered  .  What Fourier could not , indeed , see in his time is that this circle is gradually narrowing ; that the movement becomes more and more a spiral , and must come to an end , like the movement of planets , by collision with the centre  .  It is the compelling force of anarchy in the production of society at large that more and more completely turns the great majority of men into proletarians ; and it is the masses of the proletariat again who will finally put an end to anarchy in production  .  It is the compelling force of anarchy in social production that turns the limitless perfectibility of machinery under modern industry into a compulsory law by which every individual industrial capitalist must perfect his machinery more and more , under penalty of ruin  . \
But the perfecting of machinery is making human labor superfluous  .  If the introduction and increase of machinery means the displacement of millions of manual by a few machine-workers , improvement in machinery means the displacement of more and more of the machine-workers themselves  .  It means , in the last instance , the production of a number of available wage workers in excess of the average needs of capital , the formation of a complete industrial reserve army , as I called it in 1845\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm#3"}}{\fldrslt  [ 3 ]}} , available at the times when industry is working at high pressure , to be cast out upon the street when the inevitable crash comes , a constant dead weight upon the limbs of the working-class in its struggle for existence with capital , a regulator for keeping of wages down to the low level that suits the interests of capital  . \
Thus it comes about , to quote Marx , that machinery becomes the most powerful weapon in the war of capital against the working-class ; that the instruments of labor constantly tear the means of subsistence out of the hands of the laborer ; that they very product of the worker is turned into an instrument for his subjugation  . \
Thus it comes about that the economizing of the instruments of labor becomes at the same time , from the outset , the most reckless waste of labor-power , and robbery based upon the normal conditions under which labor functions ; that machinery ,\
  "  the most powerful instrument for shortening labor time , becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the laborer's time and that of his family at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital  .   "   (  Capital , English edition ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm#a72"}}{\fldrslt p  .  406}}  )\
Thus it comes about that the overwork of some becomes the preliminary condition for the idleness of others , and that modern industry , which hunts after new consumers over the whole world , forces the consumption of the masses at home down to a starvation minimum , and in doing thus destroys its own home market  . \
  "  The law that always equilibrates the relative surplus- population , or industrial reserve army , to the extent and energy of accumulation , this law rivets the laborer to capital more firmly than the wedges of Vulcan did Prometheus to the rock  .  It establishes an accumulation of misery , corresponding with the accumulation of capital  .  Accumulation of wealth at one pole is , therefore , at the same time accumulation of misery , agony of toil , slavery , ignorance , brutality , mental degradation , at the opposite pole , i  . e  .  , on the side of the class that produces\'a0its own product in the form of capital\'a0(  Marx's\'a0Capital ,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm#25a"}}{\fldrslt p  .  661}}  )\
And to expect any other division of the products from the capitalist mode of production is the same as expecting the electrodes of a battery not to decompose acidulated water , not to liberate oxygen at the positive , hydrogen at the negative pole , so long as they are connected with the battery  . \
We have seen that the ever-increasing perfectibility of modern machinery is , by the anarchy of social production , turned into a compulsory law that forces the individual industrial capitalist always to improve his machinery , always to increase its productive force  .  The bare possibility of extending the field of production is transformed for him into a similarly compulsory law  .  The enormous expansive force of modern industry , compared with which that of gases is mere child's play , appears to us now as a\'a0necessity\'a0for expansion , both qualitative and quantative , that laughs at all resistance  .  Such resistance is offered by consumption , by sales , by the markets for the products of modern industry  .  But the capacity for extension , extensive and intensive , of the markets is primarily governed by quite different laws that work much less energetically  .  The extension of the markets cannot keep pace with the extension of production  .  The collision becomes inevitable , and as this cannot produce any real solution so long as it does not break in pieces the capitalist mode of production , the collisions become periodic  .  Capitalist production has begotten another   "  vicious circle  "    . \
As a matter of fact , since 1825 , when the first general crisis broke out , the whole industrial and commercial world , production and exchange among all civilized peoples and their more or less barbaric hangers-on , are thrown out of joint about once every 10 years  .  Commerce is at a stand-still , the markets are glutted , products accumulate , as multitudinous as they are unsaleable , hard cash disappears , credit vanishes , factories are closed , the mass of the workers are in want of the means of subsistence , because they have produced too much of the means of subsistence ; bankruptcy follows upon bankruptcy , execution upon execution  .  The stagnation lasts for years ; productive forces and products are wasted and destroyed wholesale , until the accumulated mass of commodities finally filter off , more or less depreciated in value , until production and exchange gradually begin to move again  .  Little by little , the pace quickens  .  It becomes a trot  .  The industrial trot breaks into a canter , the canter in turn grows into the headlong gallop of a perfect steeplechase of industry , commercial credit , and speculation , which finally , after breakneck leaps , ends where it began \'97 in the ditch of a crisis  .  And so over and over again  .  We have now , since the year 1825 , gone through this five times , and at the present moment (  1877  ) , we are going through it for the sixth time  .  And the character of these crises is so clearly defined that Fourier hit all of them off when he described the first   "  crise plethorique  "   , a crisis from plethora  . \
In these crises , the contradiction between socialized production and capitalist appropriation ends in a violent explosion  .  The circulation of commodities is , for the time being , stopped  .  Money , the means of circulation , becomes a hindrance to circulation  .  All the laws of production and circulation of commodities are turned upside down  .  The economic collision has reached its apogee  . \'a0The mode of production is in rebellion against the mode of exchange  . \
The fact that the socialized organization of production within the factory has developed so far that it has become incompatible with the anarchy of production in society , which exists side by side with and dominates it , is brought home to the capitalist themselves by the violent concentration of capital that occurs during crises , through the ruin of many large , and a still greater number of small , capitalists  .  The whole mechanism of the capitalist mode of production breaks down under the pressure of the productive forces , its own creations  .  It is no longer able to turn all this mass of means of production into capital  .  They lie fallow , and for that very reason the industrial reserve army must also lie fallow  .  Means of production , means of subsistence , available laborers , all the elements of production and of general wealth , are present in abundance  .  But   "  abundance becomes the source of distress and want  "   (  Fourier  ) , because it is the very thing that prevents the transformation of the means of production and subsistence into capital  .  For in capitalistic society , the means of production can only function when they have undergone a preliminary transformation into capital , into the means of exploiting human labor-power  .  The necessity of this transformation into capital of the means of production and subsistence stands like a ghost between these and the workers  .  It alone prevents the coming together of the material and personal levers of production ; it alone forbids the means of production to function , the workers to work and live  .  On the one hand , therefore , the capitalistic mode of production stands convicted of its own incapacity to further direct these productive forces  .  On the other , these productive forces themselves , with increasing energy , press forward to the removal of the existing contradiction , to the abolition of their quality as capital , to the\'a0practical recognition of their character as social production forces  . \
This rebellion of the productive forces , as they grow more and more powerful , against their quality as capital , this stronger and stronger command that their social character shall be recognized , forces the capital class itself to treat them more and more as social productive forces , so far as this is possible under capitalist conditions  .  The period of industrial high pressure , with its unbounded inflation of credit , not less than the crash itself , by the collapse of great capitalist establishments , tends to bring about that form of the socialization of great masses of the means of production which we meet with in the different kinds of joint-stock companies  .  Many of these means of production and of distribution are , from the outset , so colossal that , like the railways , they exclude all other forms of capitalistic expansion  .  At a further stage of evolution , this form also becomes insufficient  .  The producers on a large scale in a particular branch of an industry in a particular country unite in a   "  Trust  "   , a union for the purpose of regulating production  .  They determine the total amount to be produced , parcel it out among themselves , and thus enforce the selling price fixed beforehand  .  But trusts of this kind , as soon as business becomes bad , are generally liable to break up , and on this very account compel a yet greater concentration of association  .  The whole of a particular industry is turned into one gigantic joint-stock company ; internal competition gives place to the internal monopoly of this one company  .  This has happened in 1890 with the English alkali production , which is now , after the fusion of 48 large works , in the hands of one company , conducted upon a single plan , and with a capital of 6 ,000 ,000 pounds  . \
In the trusts , freedom of competition changes into its very opposite \'97 into monopoly ; and the production without any definite plan of capitalistic society capitulates to the production upon a definite plan of the invading socialistic society  .  Certainly , this is so far still to the benefit and advantage of the capitalists  .  But , in this case , the exploitation is so palpable , that it must break down  .  No nation will put up with production conducted by trusts , with so barefaced an exploitation of the community by a small band of dividend-mongers  . \
In any case , with trusts or without , the official representative of capitalist society \'97 the state \'97 will ultimately have to undertake the direction of production  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm#4"}}{\fldrslt  [ 4 ]}}\'a0This necessity for conversion into State property is felt first in the great institutions for intercourse and communication \'97 the post office , the telegraphs , the railways  . \
If the crises demonstrate the incapacity of the bourgeoisie for managing any longer modern productive forces , the transformation of the great establishments for production and distribution into joint-stock companies , trusts , and State property , show how unnecessary the bourgeoisie are for that purpose  .  All the social functions of the capitalist has no further social function than that of pocketing dividends , tearing off coupons , and gambling on the Stock Exchange , where the different capitalists despoil one another of their capital  .  At first , the capitalistic mode of production forces out the workers  .  Now , it forces out the capitalists , and reduces them , just as it reduced the workers , to the ranks of the surplus-population , although not immediately into those of the industrial reserve army  . \
But , the transformation \'97 either into joint-stock companies and trusts , or into State-ownership \'97 does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces  .  In the joint-stock companies and trusts , this is obvious  .  And the modern State , again , is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists  .  The modern state , no matter what its form , is essentially a capitalist machine \'97 the state of the capitalists , the ideal personification of the total national capital  .  The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces , the more does it actually become the national capitalist , the more citizens does it exploit  .  The workers remain wage-workers \'97 proletarians  .  The capitalist relation is not done away with  .  It is , rather , brought to a head  .  But , brought to a head , it topples over  .  State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict , but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution  . \
This solution can only consist in the practical recognition of the social nature of the modern forces of production , and therefore in the harmonizing with the socialized character of the means of production  .  And this can only come about by society openly and directly taking possession of the productive forces which have outgrown all control , except that of society as a whole  .  The social character of the means of production and of the products today reacts against the producers , periodically disrupts all production and exchange , acts only like a law of Nature working blindly , forcibly , destructively  .  But ,with the taking over by society of the productive forces , the social character of the means of production and of the products will be utilized by the producers with a perfect understanding of its nature , and instead of being a source of disturbance and periodical collapse , will become the most powerful lever of production itself  . \
Active social forces work exactly like natural forces  : blindly , forcibly , destructively , so long as we do not understand , and reckon with , them  .  But , when once we understand them , when once we grasp their action , their direction , their effects , it depends only upon ourselves to subject them more and more to our own will , and , by means of them , to reach our own ends  .  And this holds quite especially of the mighty productive forces of today  .  As long as we obstinately refuse to understand the nature and the character of these social means of action \'97 and this understanding goes against the grain of the capitalist mode of production , and its defenders \'97 so long these forces are at work in spite of us , in opposition to us , so long they master us , as we have shown above in detail  . \
But when once their nature is understood , they can , in the hand working together , be transformed from master demons into willing servants  .  The difference is as that between the destructive force of electricity in the lightning in the storm , and electricity under command in the telegraph and the voltaic arc ; the difference between a conflagration , and fire working in the service of man  .  With this recognition , at last , of the real nature of the productive forces of today , the social anarchy of production gives place to a social regulation of production upon a definite plan , according to the needs of the community and of each individual  .  Then the capitalist mode of appropriation , in which the product enslaves first the producer , and then the appropriator , is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the products that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production ; upon the one hand , direct social appropriation , as means to the maintenance and extension of production \'97 on the other , direct individual appropriation , as means of subsistence and of enjoyment  . \
Whilst the capitalist mode of production more and more completely transforms the great majority of the population into proletarians , it creates the power which , under penalty of its own destruction , is forced to accomplish this revolution  .  Whilst it forces on more and more of the transformation of the vast means of production , already socialized , into State property , it shows itself the way to accomplishing this revolution  . \'a0The proletariat seizes political power and turns the means of production into State property  . \
But , in doing this , it abolishes itself as proletariat , abolishes all class distinction and class antagonisms , abolishes also the State as State  .  Society , thus far , based upon class antagonisms , had need of the State  .  That is , of an organization of the particular class which was , pro tempore , the exploiting class , an organization for the purpose of preventing any interference from without with the existing conditions of production , and , therefore , especially , for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited classes in the condition of oppression corresponding with the given mode of production (  slavery , serfdom , wage-labor  )  .  The State was the official representative of society as a whole ; the gathering of it together into a visible embodiment  .  But , it was this only in so far as it was the State of that class which itself represented , for the time being , society as a whole  :\
in ancient times , the State of slaveowning citizens ;\'a0\uc0\u8232 in the Middle Ages , the feudal lords ;\'a0\u8232 in our own times , the bourgeoisie  . \
When , at last , it becomes the real representative of the whole of society , it renders itself unnecessary  .  As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection ; as soon as class rule , and the individual struggle for existence based upon our present anarchy in production , with the collisions and excesses arising from these , are removed , nothing more remains to be repressed , and a special repressive force , a State , is no longer necessary  .  The first act by virtue of which the State really constitutes itself the representative of the whole of society \'97 the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society \'97 this is , at the same time , its last independent act as a State  .  State interference in social relations becomes , in one domain after another , superfluous , and then dies out of itself ; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things , and by the conduct of processes of production  .  The State is not   "  abolished  "    . \'a0It dies out  . \'a0This gives the measure of the value of the phrase  :   "  a free State  "   , both as to its justifiable use at times by agitators , and as to its ultimate scientific insufficiency ; and also of the demands of the so-called anarchists for the abolition of the State out of hand  . \
Since the historical appearance of the capitalist mode of production , the appropriation by society of all the means of production has often been dreamed of , more or less vaguely , by individuals , as well as by sects , as the ideal of the future  .  But it could become possible , could become a historical necessity , only when the actual conditions for its realization were there  .  Like every other social advance , it becomes practicable , not by men understanding that the existence of classes is in contradiction to justice , equality , etc  .  , not by the mere willingness to abolish these classes , but by virtue of certain new economic conditions  .  The separation of society into an exploiting and an exploited class , a ruling and an oppressed class , was the necessary consequences of the deficient and restricted development of production in former times  .  So long as the total social labor only yields a produce which but slightly exceeds that barely necessary for the existence of all ; so long , therefore , as labor engages all or almost all the time of the great majority of the members of society \'97 so long , of necessity , this society is divided into classes  .  Side by side with the great majority , exclusively bond slaves to labor , arises a class freed from directly productive labor , which looks after the general affairs of society  : the direction of labor , State business , law , science , art , etc  .  It is , therefore , the law of division of labor that lies at the basis of the division into classes  .  But this does not prevent this division into classes from being carried out by means of violence and robbery , trickery and fraud  .  it does not prevent the ruling class , once having the upper hand , from consolidating its power at the expense of the working-class , from turning its social leadership into an intensified exploitation of the masses  . \
But if , upon this showing , division into classes has a certain historical justification , it has this only for a given period , only under given social conditions  .  It was based upon the insufficiency of production  .  It will be swept away by the complete development of modern productive forces  .  And , in fact , the abolition of classes in society presupposes a degree of historical evolution at which the existence , not simply of this or that particular ruling class , but of any ruling class at all , and , therefore , the existence of class distinction itself , has become a obsolete anachronism  .  It presupposes , therefore , the development of production carried out to a degree at which appropriation of the means of production and of the products , and , with this , of political domination , of the monopoly of culture , and of intellectual leadership by a particular class of society , has become not only superfluous but economically , politically , intellectually , a hindrance to development  . \
This point is now reached  .  Their political and intellectual bankruptcy is scarcely any longer a secret to the bourgeoisie themselves  .  Their economic bankruptcy recurs regularly every 10 years  .  In every crisis , society is suffocated beneath the weight of its own productive forces and products , which it cannot use , and stands helpless , face-to-face with the absurd contradiction that the producers have nothing to consume , because consumers are wanting  .  The expansive force of the means of production burst the bonds that the capitalist mode of production had imposed upon them  .  Their deliverance from these bonds is the one precondition for an unbroken , constantly-accelerated development of the productive forces , and therewith for a practically unlimited increase of production itself  .  Nor is this all  .  The socialized appropriation of the means of production does away , not only with the present artificial restrictions upon production , but also with the positive waste and devastation of productive forces and products that are at the present time the inevitable concomitants of production , and that reach their height in the crises  .  Further , it sets free for the community at large a mass of means of production and of products , by doing away with the senseless extravagance of the ruling classes of today , and their political representatives  .  The possibility of securing for every member of society , by means of socialized production , an existence not only fully sufficient materially , and becoming day-by-day more full , but an existence guaranteeing to all the free development and exercise of their physical and mental faculties \'97 this possibility is now , for the first time , here , but\'a0it is here  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm#5"}}{\fldrslt  [ 5 ]}}\
With the seizing of the means of production by society , production of commodities is done away with , and , simultaneously , the mastery of the product over the producer  .  Anarchy in social production is replaced by systematic , definite organization  .  The struggle for individual existence disappears  .  Then , for the first time , man , in a certain sense , is finally marked off from the rest of the animal kingdom , and emerges from mere animal conditions of existence into really human ones  .  The whole sphere of the conditions of life which environ man , and which have hitherto ruled man , now comes under the dominion and control of man , who for the first time becomes the real , conscious lord of nature , because he has now become master of his own social organization  .  The laws of his own social action , hitherto standing face-to-face with man as laws of Nature foreign to , and dominating him , will then be used with full understanding , and so mastered by him  .  Man's own social organization , hitherto confronting him as a necessity imposed by Nature and history , now becomes the result of his own free action  .  The extraneous objective forces that have , hitherto , governed history ,pass under the control of man himself  .  Only from that time will man himself , more and more consciously , make his own history \'97 only from that time will the social causes set in movement by him have , in the main and in a constantly growing measure , the results intended by him  .  It is the ascent of man from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom  . \
Let us briefly sum up our sketch of historical evolution  . \
I  .  Mediaeval Society \'97\'a0Individual production on a small scale  .  Means of production adapted for individual use ; hence primitive , ungainly , petty , dwarfed in action  .  Production for immediate consumption , either of the producer himself or his feudal lord  .  Only where an excess of production over this consumption occurs is such excess offered for sale , enters into exchange  .  Production of commodities , therefore , only in its infancy  .  But already it contains within itself , in embryo , anarchy in the production of society at large  . \
II  .  Capitalist Revolution \'97\'a0transformation of industry , at first be means of simple cooperation and manufacture  .  Concentration of the means of production , hitherto scattered , into great workshops  .  As a consequence , their transformation from individual to social means of production \'97 a transformation which does not , on the whole , affect the form of exchange  .  The old forms of appropriation remain in force  .  The capitalist appears  .  In his capacity as owner of the means of production , he also appropriates the products and turns them into commodities  .  Production has become a\'a0social\'a0act  .  Exchange and appropriation continue to be\'a0individual\'a0acts , the acts of individuals  .  The social product is appropriated by the individual capitalist  .  Fundamental contradiction , whence arise all the contradictions in which our present-day society moves , and which modern industry brings to light  . \
A  .  Severance of the producer from the means of production  .  Condemnation of the worker to wage-labor for life  . \'a0Antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie  . \
B  .  Growing predominance and increasing effectiveness of the laws governing the production of commodities  .  Unbridled competition  . \'a0Contradiction between socialized organization in the individual factory and social anarchy in the production as a whole  . \
C  .  On the one hand , perfecting of machinery , made by competition compulsory for each individual manufacturer , and complemented by a constantly growing displacement of laborers  . \'a0Industrial reserve-army  .  On the other hand , unlimited extension of production , also compulsory under competition , for every manufacturer  .  On both sides , unheard-of development of productive forces , excess of supply over demand , over-production and products \'97 excess there , of laborers , without employment and without means of existence  .  But these two levers of production and of social well-being are unable to work together , because the capitalist form of production prevents the productive forces from working and the products from circulating , unless they are first turned into capital \'97 which their very superabundance prevents  .  The contradiction has grown into an absurdity  . \'a0The mode of production rises in rebellion against the form of exchange  . \
D  .  Partial recognition of the social character of the productive forces forced upon the capitalists themselves  .  Taking over of the great institutions for production and communication , first by joint-stock companies , later in by trusts , then by the State  .  The bourgeoisie demonstrated to be a superfluous class  .  All its social functions are now performed by salaried employees  . \
III  .  Proletarian Revolution \'97\'a0Solution of the contradictions  .  The proletariat seizes the public power , and by means of this transforms the socialized means of production , slipping from the hands of the bourgeoisie , into public property  .  By this act , the proletariat frees the means of production from the character of capital they have thus far borne , and gives their socialized character complete freedom to work itself out  .  Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible  .  The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism  .  In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes , the political authority of the State dies out  .  Man , at last the master of his own form of social organization , becomes at the same time the lord over Nature , his own master \'97 free  . \
To accomplish this act of universal emancipation is the historical mission of the modern proletariat  .  To thoroughly comprehend the historical conditions and this the very nature of this act , to impart to the now oppressed proletarian class a full knowledge of the conditions and of the meaning of the momentous act it is called upon to accomplish , this is the task of the theoretical expression of the proletarian movement , scientific Socialism  . \
The volume before us\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt (  1  )}}\'a0carries us back to a period which , although in time no more than a generation behind us , has become as foreign to the present generation in Germany as if it were already a hundred years old  .  Yet it was the period of Germany\'92s preparation for the Revolution of 1848 ; and all that has happened since then in our country has been merely a continuation of 1848 , merely the execution of the last will and testament of the revolution  . \
Just as in France in the 18th century , so in Germany in the 19th , a philosophical revolution ushered in the political collapse  .  But how different the two looked  ! The French were in open combat against all official science , against the church and often also against the state ; their writings were printed across the frontier , in Holland or England , while they themselves were often in jeopardy of imprisonment in the Bastille  .  On the other hand , the Germans were professors , state-appointed instructors of youth ; their writings were recognized textbooks , and the termination system of the whole development \'97 the Hegelian system \'97 was even raised , as it were , to the rank of a royal Prussian philosophy of state  ! Was it possible that a revolution could hide behind these professors , behind their obscure , pedantic phrases , their ponderous , wearisome sentences  ? Were not precisely these people who were then regarded as the representatives of the revolution , the liberals , the bitterest opponents of this brain-confusing philosophy  ? But what neither the government nor the liberals saw was seen at least by one man as early as 1833 , and this man was indeed none other than Heinrich Heine  . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\
Let us take an example  .  No philosophical proposition has earned more gratitude from narrow-minded governments and wrath from equally narrow-minded liberals than Hegel\'92s famous statement  : \'93All that is real is rational ; and all that is rational is real  . \'94 That was tangibly a sanctification of things that be , a philosophical benediction bestowed upon despotism , police government , Star Chamber proceedings and censorship  .  That is how Frederick William III and how his subjects understood it  .  But according to Hegel certainly not everything that exists is also real , without further qualification  .  For Hegel the attribute of reality belongs only to that which at the same time is necessary  : \'93In the course of its development reality proves to be necessity  . \'94 A particular governmental measure \'97 Hegel himself cites the example of \'93a certain tax regulation\'94 \'97 is therefore for him by no means real without qualification  .  That which is necessary , however , proves itself in the last resort to be also rational ; and , applied to the Prussian state of that time , the Hegelian proposition , therefore , merely means  : this state is rational , corresponds to reason , insofar as it is necessary ; and if it nevertheless appears to us to be evil , but still , in spite of its evil character , continues to exist , then the evil character of the government is justified and explained by the corresponding evil character of its subjects  .  The Prussians of that day had the government that they deserved  . \
Now , according to Hegel , reality is , however , in no way an attribute predictable of any given state of affairs , social or political , in all circumstances and at all times  .  On the contrary  .  The Roman Republic was real , but so was the Roman Empire , which superseded it  .  In 1789 , the French monarchy had become so unreal , that is to say , so robbed of all necessity , so irrational , that it had to be destroyed by the Great Revolution , of which Hegel always speaks with the greatest enthusiasm  .  In this case , therefore , the monarchy was the unreal and the revolution the real  .  And so , in the course of development , all that was previously real becomes unreal , loses it necessity , its right of existence , its rationality  .  And in the place of moribund reality comes a new , viable reality \'97 peacefully if the old has enough intelligence to go to its death without a struggle ; forcibly if it resists this necessity  .  Thus the Hegelian proposition turns into its opposite through Hegelian dialectics itself  : All that is real in the sphere of human history , becomes irrational in the process of time , is therefore irrational by its very destination , is tainted beforehand with irrationality , and everything which is rational in the minds of men is destined to become real , however much it may contradict existing apparent reality  .  In accordance with all the rules of the Hegelian method of thought , the proposition of the rationality of everything which is real resolves itself into the other proposition  : All that exists deserves to perish  . \
But precisely therein lay the true significance and the revolutionary character of the Hegelian philosophy (  to which , as the close of the whole movement since Kant , we must here confine ourselves  ) , that it once and for all dealt the death blow to the finality of all product of human thought and action  .  Truth , the cognition of which is the business of philosophy , was in the hands of Hegel no longer an aggregate of finished dogmatic statements , which , once discovered , had merely to be learned by heart  .  Truth lay now in the process of cognition itself , in the long historical development of science , which mounts from lower to ever higher levels of knowledge without ever reaching , by discovering so-called absolute truth , a point at which it can proceed no further , where it would have nothing more to do than to fold its hands and gaze with wonder at the absolute truth to which it had attained  .  And what holds good for the realm of philosophical knowledge holds good also for that of every other kind of knowledge and also for practical action  .  Just as knowledge is unable to reach a complete conclusion in a perfect , ideal condition of humanity , so is history unable to do so ; a perfect society , a perfect \'93state\'94 , are things which can only exist in imagination  .  On the contrary , all successive historical systems are only transitory stages in the endless course of development of human society from the lower to the higher  .  Each stage is necessary , and therefore justified for the time and conditions to which it owes its origin  .  But in the face of new , higher conditions which gradually develop in its own womb , it loses vitality and justification  .  It must give way to a higher stage which will also in its turn decay and perish  .  Just as the bourgeoisie by large-scale industry , competition , and the world market dissolves in practice all stable time-honored institutions , so this dialectical philosophy dissolves all conceptions of final , absolute truth and of absolute states of humanity corresponding to it  .  For it  [ dialectical philosophy ] , nothing is final , absolute , sacred  .  It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything ; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away , of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher  .  And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain  .  It has , of course , also a conservative side ; it recognizes that definite stages of knowledge and society are justified for their time and circumstances ; but only so far  .  The conservatism of this mode of outlook is relative ; its revolutionary character is absolute \'97 the only absolute dialectical philosophy admits  . \
It is not necessary , here , to go into the question of whether this mode of outlook is thoroughly in accord with the present state of natural science , which predicts a possible end even for the Earth , and for its habitability a fairly certain one ; which therefore recognizes that for the history of mankind , too , there is not only an ascending but also a descending branch  .  At any rate , we still find ourselves a considerable distance from the turning-point at which the historical course of society becomes one of descent , and we cannot expect Hegelian philosophy to be concerned with a subject which natural science , in its time , had not at all placed upon the agenda as yet  . \
But what must , in fact , be said here is this  : that in Hegel the views developed above are not so sharply delineated  .  They are a necessary conclusion from his method , but one which he himself never drew with such explicitness  .  And this , indeed , for the simple reason that he was compelled to make a system and , in accordance with traditional requirements , a system of philosophy must conclude with some sort of absolute truth  .  Therefore , however much Hegel , especially in his\'a0Logic , emphasized that this eternal truth is nothing but the logical , or , the historical , process itself , he nevertheless finds himself compelled to supply this process with an end , just because he has to bring his system to a termination at some point or other  .  In his\'a0Logic , he can make this end a beginning again , since here the point of the conclusion , the absolute idea \'97 which is only absolute insofar as he has absolutely nothing to say about it \'97 \'93alienates\'94 , that is , transforms , itself into nature and comes to itself again later in the mind , that is , in thought and in history  .  But at the end of the whole philosophy , a similar return to the beginning is possible only in one way  .  Namely , by conceiving of the end of history as follows  : mankind arrives at the cognition of the self-same absolute idea , and declares that this cognition of the absolute idea is reached in Hegelian philosophy  .  In this way , however , the whole dogmatic content of the Hegelian system is declared to be absolute truth , in contradiction to his dialectical method , which dissolves all dogmatism  .  Thus the revolutionary side is smothered beneath the overgrowth of the conservative side  .  And what applies to philosophical cognition applies also to historical practice  .  Mankind , which , in the person of Hegel , has reached the point of working out the absolute idea , must also in practice have gotten so far that it can carry out this absolute idea in reality  .  Hence the practical political demands of the absolute idea on contemporaries may not be stretched too far  .  And so we find at the conclusion of the\'a0Philosophy of Right\'a0that the absolute idea is to be realized in that monarchy based on social estates which Frederick William III so persistently but vainly promised to his subjects , that is , in a limited , moderate , indirect rule of the possessing classes suited to the petty-bourgeois German conditions of that time ; and , moreover , the necessity of the nobility is demonstrated to us in a speculative fashion  . \
The inner necessities of the system are , therefore , of themselves sufficient to explain why a thoroughly revolutionary method of thinking produced an extremely tame political conclusion  .  As a matter of fact , the specific form of this conclusion springs from this , that Hegel was a German , and like his contemporary Goethe had a bit of the philistine\'92s queue dangling behind  .  Each of them was an Olympian Zeus in his own sphere , yet neither of them ever quite freed himself from German philistinism  . \
But all this did not prevent the Hegelian system from covering an incomparably greater domain than any earlier system , nor from developing in this domain a wealth of thought , which is astounding even today  .  The phenomenology of mind (  which one may call a parallel of the embryology and palaeontology of the mind , a development of individual consciousness through its different stages , set in the form of an abbreviated reproduction of the stages through which the consciousness of man has passed in the course of history  ) , logic , natural philosophy , philosophy of mind , and the latter worked out in its separate , historical subdivisions  : philosophy of history , of right , of religion , history of philosophy , aesthetics , etc  .  \'97 in all these different historical fields Hegel labored to discover and demonstrate the pervading thread of development  .  And as he was not only a creative genius but also a man of encyclopaedic erudition , he played an epoch-making role in every sphere  .  It is self-evident that owing to the needs of the \'93system\'94 he very often had to resort to those forced constructions about which his pigmy opponents make such a terrible fuss even today  .  But these constructions are only the frame and scaffolding of his work  .  If one does not loiter here needlessly , but presses on farther into the immense building , one finds innumerable treasures which today still possess undiminshed value  .  With all philosophers it is precisely the \'93system\'94 which is perishable ; and for the simple reason that it springs from an imperishable desire of the human mind \'97 the desire to overcome all contradictions  .  But if all contradictions are once and for all disposed of , we shall have arrived at so-called absolute truth \'97 world history will be at an end  .  And yet it has to continue , although there is nothing left for it to do \'97 hence , a new , insoluble contradiction  .  As soon as we have once realized \'97 and in the long run no one has helped us to realize it more than Hegel himself \'97 that the task of philosophy thus stated means nothing but the task that a single philosopher should accomplish that which can only be accomplished by the entire human race in its progressive development \'97 as soon as we realize that , there is an end to all philosophy in the hitherto accepted sense of the word  .  One leaves alone \'93absolute truth\'94 , which is unattainable along this path or by any single individual ; instead , one pursues attainable relative truths along the path of the positive sciences , and the summation of their results by means of dialectical thinking  .  At any rate , with Hegel philosophy comes to an end ; on the one hand , because in his system he summed up its whole development in the most splendid fashion ; and on the other hand , because , even though unconsciously , he showed us the way out of the labyrinth of systems to real positive knowledge of the world  . \
One can imagine what a tremendous effect this Hegelian system must have produced in the philosophy-tinged atmosphere of Germany  .  It was a triumphant procession which lasted for decades and which by no means came to a standstill on the death of Hegel  .  On the contrary , it was precisely from 1830 to 1840 that \'93Hegelianism\'94 reigned most exclusively , and to a greater or lesser extent infected even its opponents  .  It was precisely in this period that Hegelian views , consciously or unconsciously , most extensively penetrated the most diversified sciences and leavened even popular literature and the daily press , from which the average \'93educated consciousness\'94 derives its mental pabulum  .  But this victory along the whole front was only the prelude to an internal struggle  . \
As we have seen , the doctrine of Hegel , taken as a whole , left plenty of room for giving shelter to the most diverse practical party views  .  And in the theoretical Germany of that time , two things above all were practical  : religion and politics  .  Whoever placed the chief emphasis on the Hegelian\'a0system\'a0could be fairly conservative in both spheres ; whoever regarded the dialectical\'a0method\'a0as the main thing could belong to the most extreme opposition , both in politics and religion  .  Hegel himself , despite the fairly frequent outbursts of revolutionary wrath in his works , seemed on the whole to be more inclined to the conservative side  .  Indeed , his system had cost him much more \'93hard mental plugging\'94 than his method  .  Towards the end of the thirties , the cleavage in the school became more and more apparent  .  The Left wing , the so-called Young Hegelians , in their fight with the pietist orthodox and the feudal reactionaries , abandoned bit by bit that philosophical-genteel reserve in regard to the burning questions of the day which up to that time had secured state toleration and even protection for their teachings  .  And when in 1840 , orthodox pietism and absolutist feudal reaction ascended the throne with Frederick William IV , open partisanship became unavoidable  .  The fight was still carried on with philosophical weapons , but no longer for abstract philosophical aims  .  It turned directly on the destruction of traditional religion and of the existing state  .  And while in the\'a0Deutsche Jahrbucher\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}the practical ends were still predominantly put forward in philosophical disguise , in the\'a0Rheinische Zeitung\'a0of 1842 the Young Hegelian school revealed itself directly as the philosophy of the aspiring radical bourgeoisie and used the meagre cloak of philosophy only to deceive the censorship  . \
At that time , however , politics was a very thorny field , and hence the main fight came to be directed against religion ; this fight , particularly since 1840 , was indirectly also political  .  Strauss\'92\'a0Life of Jesus , published in 1835 , had provided the first impulse  .  The theory therein developed of the formation of the gospel myths was combated later by Bruno Bauer with proof that a whole series of evangelic stories had been fabricated by the authors themselves  .  The controversy between these two was carried out in the philosophical disguise of a battle between \'93self-consciousness\'94 and \'93substance\'94  .  The question whether the miracle stories of the gospels came into being through unconscious-traditional myth-creation within the bosom of the community or whether they were fabricated by the evangelists themselves was magnified into the question whether , in world history , \'93substance\'94 or \'93self-consciousness\'94 was the decisive operative force  .  Finally came Stirner , the prophet of contemporary anarchism \'97 Bakunin has taken a great deal from him \'97 and capped the sovereign \'93self-consciousness\'94 by his sovereign \'93ego\'94{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#C"}}{\fldrslt  [ C ]}}  . \
We will not go further into this side of the decomposition process of the Hegelian school  .  More important for us is the following  : the main body of the most determined Young Hegelians was , by the practical necessities of its fight against positive religion , driven back to Anglo-French materialism  .  This brought them into conflict with the system of their school  .  While materialism conceives nature as the sole reality , nature in the Hegelian system represents merely the \'93alienation\'94 of the absolute idea , so to say , a degradation of the idea  .  At all events , thinking and its thought-product , the idea , is here the primary , nature the derivative , which only exists at all by the condescension of the idea  .  And in this contradiction they floundered as well or as ill as they could  . \
Then came Feuerbach\'92s\'a0Essence of Christianity{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#D"}}{\fldrslt  [ D ]}}  .  With one blow , it pulverized the contradiction , in that without circumlocutions it placed materialism on the throne again  .  Nature exists independently of all philosophy  .  It is the foundation upon which we human beings , ourselves products of nature , have grown up  .  Nothing exists outside nature and man , and the higher beings our religious fantasies have created are only the fantastic reflection of our own essence  .  The spell was broken ; the \'93system\'94 was exploded and cast aside , and the contradiction , shown to exist only in our imagination , was dissolved  .  One must himself have experienced the liberating effect of this book to get an idea of it  .  Enthusiasm was general ; we all became at once Feuerbachians  .  How enthusiastically Marx greeted the new conception and how much \'97 in spite of all critical reservations \'97 he was influenced by it , one may read in the\'a0The Holy Family{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.htm#E"}}{\fldrslt  [ E ]}}  . \
Even the shortcomings of the book contributed to its immediate effect  .  Its literary , sometimes even high-flown , style secured for it a large public and was at any rate refreshing after long years of abstract and abstruse Hegelianizing  .  The same is true of its extravagant deification of love , which , coming after the now intolerable sovereign rule of \'93pure reason\'94 , had its excuse , if not justification  .  But what we must not forget is that it was precisely these two weaknesses of Feuerbach that \'93true Socialism\'94 , which had been spreading like a plague in educated Germany since 1844 , took as its starting-point , putting literary phrases in the place of scientific knowledge , the liberation of mankind by means of \'93love\'94 in place of the emancipation of the proletariat through the economic transformation of production \'97 in short , losing itself in the nauseous fine writing and ecstacies of love typified by Herr Karl Grun  . \
Another thing we must not forget is this  : the Hegelian school disintegrated , but Hegelian philosophy was not overcome through criticism ; Strauss and Bauer each took one of its sides and set it polemically against the other  .  Feuerbach smashed the system and simply discarded it  .  But a philosophy is not disposed of by the mere assertion that it is false  .  And so powerful a work as Hegelian philosophy , which had exercised so enormous an influence on the intellectual development of the nation , could not be disposed of by simply being ignored  .  It had to be \'93sublated\'94 in its own sense , that is , in the sense that while its form had to be annihilatedhrough criticism , the new content which had been won through it had to be saved  .  How this was brought about we shall see below  . \
But in the meantime , the Revolution of 1848 thrust the whole of philosophy aside as unceremoniously as Feuerbach had thrust aside Hegel  .  And in the process , Feuerbach himself was also pushed into the backgroun\
\'a0\
The great basic question of all philosophy , especially of more recent philosophy , is that concerning the relation of thinking and being  .  From the very early times when men , still completely ignorant of the structure of their own bodies , under the stimulus of dream apparitions\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch02.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt (  1  )}}\'a0came to believe that their thinking and sensation were not activities of their bodies , but of a distinct soul which inhabits the body and leaves it at death \'97 from this time men have been driven to reflect about the relation between this soul and the outside world  .  If , upon death , it took leave of the body and lived on , there was no occassion to invent yet another distinct death for it  .  Thus arose the idea of immortality , which at that stage of development appeared not at all as a consolation but as a fate against which it was no use fighting , and often enough , as among the Greeks , as a positive misfortune  .  The quandry arising from the common universal ignorance of what to do with this soul , once its existence had been accepted , after the death of the body , and not religious desire for consolation , led in a general way to the tedious notion of personal immortality  .  In an exactly similar manner , the first gods arose through the personification of natural forces  .  And these gods in the further development of religions assumed more and more extramundane form , until finally by a process of abstraction , I might almost say of distillation , occurring naturally in the course of man\'92s intellectual development , out of the many more or less limited and mutually limiting gods there arose in the minds of men the idea of the one exclusive God of the monotheistic religions  . \
Thus the question of the relation of thinking to being , the relation of the spirit to nature \'97 the paramount question of the whole of philosophy \'97 has , no less than all religion , its roots in the narrow-minded and ignorant notions of savagery  .  But this question could for the first time be put forward in its whole acuteness , could achieve its full significance , only after humanity in Europe had awakened from the long hibernation of the Christian Middle Ages  .  The question of the position of thinking in relation to being , a question which , by the way , had played a great part also in the scholasticism of the Middle Ages , the question  : which is primary , spirit or nature \'97 that question , in relation to the church , was sharpened into this  : Did God create the world or has the world been in existence eternally  ?\
The answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps  .  Those who asserted the primacy of spirit to nature and , therefore , in the last instance , assumed world creation in some form or other \'97 and among the philosophers , Hegel , for example , this creation often becomes still more intricate and impossible than in Christianity \'97 comprised the camp of idealism  .  The others , who regarded nature as primary , belong to the various schools of materialism  . \
These two expressions , idealism and materialism , originally signify nothing else but this ; and here too they are not used in any other sense  .  What confusion arises when some other meaning is put to them will be seen below  . \
But the question of the relation of thinking and being had yet another side  : in what relation do our thoughts about the world surrounding us stand to this world itself  ? Is our thinking capable of the cognition of the real world  ? Are we able in our ideas and notions of the real world to produce a correct reflection of reality  ? In philosophical language this question is called the question of identity of thinking and being , and the overwhelming majority of philosophers give an affirmative answer to this question  .  With Hegel , for example , its affirmation is self-evident ; for what we cognize in the real world is precisely its thought-content \'97 that which makes the world a gradual realization of the absolute idea , which absolute idea has existed somewhere from eternity , independent of the world and before the world  .  But it is manifest without further proof that thought can know a content which is from the outset a thought-content  .  It is equally manifest that what is to be proved here is already tacitly contained in the premises  .  But that in no way prevents Hegel from drawing the further conclusion from his proof of the identity of thinking and being that his philosophy , because it is correct for his thinking , is therefore the only correct one , and that the identity of thinking and being must prove its validity by mankind immediately translating his philosophy from theory into practice and transforming the whole world according to Hegelian principles  .  This is an illusion which he shares with well-nigh all philosophers  . \
In addition , there is yet a set of different philosophers \'97 those who question the possibility of any cognition , or at least of an exhaustive cognition , of the world  .  To them , among the more modern ones , belong Hume and Kant , and they played a very important role in philosophical development  .  What is decisive in the refutation of this view has already been said by Hegel , in so far as this was possible from an idealist standpoint  .  The materialistic additions made by Feuerbach are more ingenious than profound  .  The most telling refutation of this as of all other philosophical crotchets is practice \'97 namely , experiment and industry  .  If we are able to prove the correctness of our conception of a natural process by making it ourselves , bringing it into being out of its conditions and making it serve our own purposes into the bargain , then there is an end to the Kantian ungraspable \'93thing-in-itself\'94  .  The chemical substances produced in the bodies of plants and animals remained just such \'93things-in-themselves\'94 until organic chemistry began to produce them one after another , whereupon the \'93thing-in-itself\'94 became a thing for us \'97 as , for instance , alizarin , the coloring matter of the madder , which we no longer trouble to grow in the madder roots in the field , but produce much more cheaply and simply from coal tar  .  For 300 years , the Copernican solar system was a hypothesis with 100 , 1 ,000 , 10 ,000 to 1 chances in its favor , but still always a hypothesis  .  But then Leverrier , by means of the data provided by this system , not only deduced the necessity of the existence of an unknown planet , but also calculated the position in the heavens which this planet must necessarily occupy , and when  [ Johann ] Galle really found this planet  [ Neptune , discovered 1846 , at Berlin Observatory ] , the Copernican system was proved  .  If , nevertheless , the neo-Kantians are attempting to resurrect the Kantian conception in Germany , and the agnostics that of Hume in England (  where in fact it never became extinct  ) , this is , in view of their theoretical and practical refutation accomplished long ago , scientifically a regression and practically merely a shamefaced way of surreptitiously accepting materialism , while denying it before the world  . \
But during this long period from Descartes to Hegel and from Hobbes to Feuerbach , these philosophers were by no means impelled , as they thought they were , solely by the force of pure reason  .  On the contrary , what really pushed them forward most was the powerful and ever more rapidly onrushing progress of natural science and industry  .  Among the materialists this was plain on the surface , but the idealist systems also filled themselves more and more with a materialist content and attempted pantheistically to reconcile the antithesis between mind and matter  .  Thus , ultimately , the Hegelian system represents merely a materialism idealistically turned upside down in method and content  . \
It is , therefore , comprehensible that Starcke in his characterization of Feuerbach first of all investigates the latter\'92s position in regard to this fundamental question of the relation of thinking and being  .  After a short introduction , in which the views of the preceding philosophers , particularly since Kant , are described in unnecessarily ponderous philosophical language , and in which Hegel , by an all too formalistic adherence to certain passages of his works , gets far less his due , there follows a detailed description of the course of development of Feuerbach\'92s \'93metaphysics\'94 itself , as this course was successively reflected in those writings of this philosopher which have a bearing here  .  This description is industriously and lucidly elaborated ; only , like the whole book , it is loaded with a ballast of philosophical phraseology by no means everywhere unavoidable , which is the more disturbing in its effect the less the author keeps to the manner of expression of one and the same school , or even of Feuerbach himself , and the more he interjects expressions of very different tendencies , especially of the tendencies now rampant and calling themselves philosophical  . \
The course of evolution of Feuerbach is that of a Hegelian \'97 a never quite orthodox Hegelian , it is true \'97 into a materialist ; an evolution which at a definite stage necessitates a complete rupture with the idealist system of his predecessor  .  With irresistible force , Feuerbach is finally driven to the realization that the Hegelian premundane existence of the \'93absolute idea\'94 , the \'93pre-existence of the logical categories\'94 before the world existed , is nothing more than the fantastic survival of the belief in the existence of an extra-mundane creator ; that the material , sensuously perceptible world to which we ourselves belong is the only reality ; and that our consciousness and thinking , however supra-sensuous they may seem , are the product of a material , bodily organ , the brain  .  Matter is not a product of mind , but mind itself is merely the highest product of matter  .  This is , of course , pure materialism  .  But , having got so far , Feuerbach stops short  .  He cannot overcome the customary philosophical prejudice , prejudice not against the thing but against the name materialism  .  He says  :\
\'93To me materialism is the foundation of the edifice of human essence and knowledge ; but to me it is not what it is to the physiologist , to the natural scientists in the narrower sense , for example , to Moleschott , and necessarily is from their standpoint and profession , namely , the edifice itself  .  Backwards I fully agree with the materialists ; but not forwards  . \'94\
Here , Feuerbach lumps together the materialism that is a general world outlook resting upon a definite conception of the relation between matter and mind , and the special form in which this world outlook was expressed at a definite historical stage \'97 namely , in the 18th century  .  More than that , he lumps it with the shallow , vulgarized form in which the materialism of the 18th century continues to exist today in the heads of naturalists and physicians , the form which was preached on their tours in the fifties by Buchner , Vogt , and Moleschott  .  But just as idealism underwent a series of stages of development , so also did materialism  .  With each epoch-making discovery even in the sphere of natural science , it has to change its form ; and after history was also subjected to materialistic treatment , a new avenue of development has opened here , too  . \
The materialism of the last century was predominantly mechanical , because at that time , of all natural sciences , only mechanics , and indeed only the mechanics of solid bodies \'97 celestial and terrestrial \'97 in short , the mechanics of gravity , had come to any definite close  .  Chemistry at that time existed only in its infantile , phlogistic form\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch02.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}  .  Biology still lay in swaddling clothes ; vegetable and animal organisms had been only roughly examined and were explained by purely mechanical causes  .  What the animal was to Descartes , man was to the materialists of the 18th century \'97 a machine  .  This exclusive application of the standards of mechanics to processes of a chemical and organic nature \'97 in which processes the laws of mechanics are , indeed , also valid , but are pushed into the backgrounds by other , higher laws \'97 constitutes the first specific but at that time inevitable limitations of classical French materialism  . \
The second specific limitation of this materialism lay in its inability to comprehend the universe as a process , as matter undergoing uninterrupted historical development  .  This was in accordance with the level of the natural science of that time , and with the metaphysical , that is , anti-dialectical manner of philosophizing connected with it  .  Nature , so much was known , was in eternal motion  .  But according to the ideas of that time , this motion turned , also eternally , in a circle and therefore never moved from the spot ; it produced the same results over and over again  .  This conception was at that time inevitable  .  The Kantian theory of the origin of the Solar System  [ that the Sun and planets originated from incandescent rotating nebulous masses ] had been put forward but recently and was still regarded merely as a curiosity  .  The history of the development of the Earth , geology , was still totally unknown , and the conception that the animate natural beings of today are the result of a long sequence of development from the simple to the complex could not at that time scientifically be put forward at all  .  The unhistorical view of nature was therefore inevitable  .  We have the less reason to reproach the philosophers of the 18th century on this account since the same thing is found in Hegel  .  According to him , nature , as a mere \'93alienation\'94 of the idea , is incapable of development in time \'97 capable only of extending its manifoldness in space , so that it displays simultaneously and alongside of one another all the stages of development comprised in it , and is condemned to an eternal repetition of the same processes  .  This absurdity of a development in space , but outside of time \'97 the fundamental condition of all development \'97 Hegel imposes upon nature just at the very time when geology , embryology , the physiology of plants and animals , and organic chemistry were being built up , and when everywhere on the basis of these new sciences brilliant foreshadowings of the later theory of evolution were appearing (  for instance , Goethe and Lamarck  )  .  But the system demanded it ; hence the method , for the sake of the system , had to become untrue to itself  . \
This same unhistorical conception prevailed also in the domain of history  .  Here the struggle against the remnants of the Middle Ages blurred the view  .  The Middle Ages were regarded as a mere interruption of history by a thousand years of universal barbarism  .  The great progress made in the Middle Ages \'97 the extension of the area of European culture , the viable great nations taking form there next to each other , and finally the enormous technical progress of the 14th and 15th centuries \'97 all this was not seen  .  Thus a rational insight into the great historical interconnectedness was made impossible , and history served at best as a collection of examples and illustrations for the use of philosophers  . \
The vulgarizing pedlars , who in Germany in the fifties dabbled in materialism , by no means overcame this limitation of their teachers  .  All the advances of natural science which had been made in the meantime served them only as new proofs against the existence of a creator of the world ; and , indeed , they did not in the least make it their business to develop the theory any further  .  Though idealism was at the end of its tether and was dealt a death-blow by the Revolution of 1848 , it had the satisfaction of seeing that materialism had for the moment fallen lower still  .  Feuerbach was unquestionably right when he refused to take responsibility for this materialism ; only he should not have confounded the doctrines of these itinerant preachers with materialism in general  . \
Here , however , there are two things to be pointed out  .  First , even during Feuerbach\'92s lifetime , natural science was still in that process of violent fermentation which only during the last 15 years had reached a clarifying , relative conclusion  .  New scientific data were acquired to a hitherto unheard-of extent , but the establishing of interrelations , and thereby the bringing of order into this chaos of discoveries following closely upon each other\'92s heels , has only quite recently become possible  .  It is true that Feuerbach had lived to see all three of the decisive discoveries \'97 that of the cell , the transformation of energy , and the theory of evolution named after Darwin  .  But how could the lonely philosopher , living in rural solitude , be able sufficiently to follow scientific developments in order to appreciate at their full value discoveries which natural scientists themselves at that time either still contested or did not know how to make adequate use of  ? The blame for this falls solely upon the wretched conditions in Germany , in consequence of which cobweb-spinning eclectic flea-crackers had taken possession of the chairs of philosophy , while Feuerbach , who towered above them all , had to rusticate and grow sour in a little village  .  It is therefore not Feuerbach\'92s fault that this historical conception of nature , which had now become possible and which removed all the one-sidedness of French materialism , remained inaccessible to him  . \
Secondly , Feuerbach is quite correct in asserting that exclusively natural-scientific materialism is indeed \'93the foundation of the edifice of human knowledge , but not the edifice itself\'94  .  For we live not only in nature but also in human society , and this also no less than nature has its history of development and its science  .  It was therefore a question of bringing the science of society , that is , the sum total of the so-called historical and philosophical sciences , into harmony with the materialist foundation , and of reconstructing it thereupon  .  But it did not fall to Feuerbach\'92s lot to do this  .  In spite of the \'93foundation\'94 , he remained here bound by the traditional idealist fetters , a fact which he recognizes in these words  : \'93Backwards I agree with the materialists , but not forwards  !\'94\
But it was Feuerbach himself who did not go \'93forwards\'94 here ; in the social domain , who did not get beyond his standpoint of 1840 or 1844  .  And this was again chiefly due to this reclusion which compelled him , who , of all philosophers , was the most inclined to social intercourse , to produce thoughts out of his solitary head instead of in amicable and hostile encounters with other men of his calibre  .  Later , we shall see in detail how much he remained an idealist in this sphere  . \
It need only be added here that Starcke looks for Feuerbach\'92s idealism in the wrong place  . \
\'93Feuerbach is an idealist ; he believes in the progress of mankind  . \'94\'a0(  p  . 19  )\
\'93The foundation , the substructure of the whole , remains nevertheless idealism  .  Realism for us is nothing more than a protection again aberrations , while we follow our ideal trends  .  Are not compassion , love , and enthusiasm for truth and justice ideal forces  ?\'94\'a0(  p  . VIII  )\
In the first place , idealism here means nothing , but the pursuit of ideal aims  .  But these necessarily have to do at the most with Kantian idealism and its \'93categorical imperative\'94 ; however , Kant himself called his philosophy \'93transcendental idealism\'94 by no means because he dealt therein also with ethical ideals , but for quite other reasons , as Starcke will remember  .  The superstitition that philosophical idealism is pivoted round a belief in ethical , that is , social , ideals , arose outside philosophy , among the German philistines , who learned by heart from Schiller\'92s poems the few morsels of philosophical culture they needed  .  No one has criticized more severely the impotent \'93categorical imperative\'94 of Kant \'97 impotent because it demands the impossible , and therefore never attains to any reality \'97 no one has more cruelly derided the philistine sentimental enthusiasm for unrealizable ideals purveyed by Schiller than precisely the complete idealist Hegel (  see , for example , his\'a0Phenomenology  )  . \
In the second place , we simply cannot get away from the fact that everything that sets men acting must find its way through their brains \'97 even eating and drinking , which begins as a consequence of the sensation of hunger or thirst transmitted through the brain , and ends as a result of the sensation of satisfaction likewise transmitted through the brain  .  The influences of the external world upon man express themselves in his brain , are reflected therein as feelings , impulses , volitions \'97 in short , as \'93ideal tendencies\'94 , and in this form become \'93ideal powers\'94  .  If , then , a man is to be deemed an idealist because he follows \'93ideal tendencies\'94 and admits that \'93ideal powers\'94 have an influence over him , then every person who is at all normally developed is a born idealist and how , in that case , can there still be any materialists  ?\
In the third place , the conviction that humanity , at least at the present moment , moves on the whole in a progressive direction has absolutely nothing to do with the antagonism between materialism and idealism  .  The French materialists no less than the deists Voltaire and Rousseau held this conviction to an almost fanatical degree , and often enough made the greatest personal sacrifices for it  .  If ever anybody dedicated his whole life to the \'93enthusiasm for truth and justice\'94 \'97 using this phrase in the good sense \'97 it was Diderot , for instance  .  If , therefore , Starcke declares all this to be idealism , this merely proves that the word materialism , and the whole antagonism between the two trends , has lost all meaning for him here  . \
The fact is that Starcke , although perhaps unconsciously , in this makes an unpardonable concession to the traditional philistine prejudice against the word materialism resulting from its long-continued defamation by the priests  .  By the word materialism , the philistine understands gluttony , drunkenness , lust of the eye , lust of the flesh , arrogance , cupidity , avarice , covetousness , profit-hunting , and stock-exchange swindling \'97 in short , all the filthy vices in which he himself indulges in private  .  By the word idealism he understands the belief in virtue , universal philanthropy , and in a general way a \'93better world\'94 , of which he boasts before others but in which he himself at the utmost believes only so long as he is having the blues or is going through the bankruptcy consequent upon his customary \'93materialist\'94 excesses  .  It is then that he sings his favorite song , What is man  ? \'97 Half beast , half angel  . \
For the rest , Starcke takes great pains to defend Feuerbach against the attacks and doctrines of the vociferous assistant professors who today go by the name of philosophers in Germany  .  For people who are interested in this afterbirth of classical German philosophy this is , of course , a matter of importance ; for Starcke himself it may have appeared necessary  .  We , however , will spare the reader this  . \
The real idealism of Feuerbach becomes evident as soon as we come to his philosophy of religion and ethics  .  He by no means wishes to abolish religion ; he wants to perfect it  .  Philosophy itself must be absorbed in religion  . \
\'93The periods of humanity are distinguished only by religious changes  .  A historical movement is fundamental only when it is rooted in the hearts of men  .  The heart is not a form of religion , so that the latter should exist\'a0also\'a0in the heart ; the heart is the essence of religion  . \'94\'a0(  Quoted by Starcke , p  . 168  .   )\
According to Feuerbach , religion is the relation between human beings based on the affections , the relation based on the heart , which relation until now has sought its truth in a fantastic mirror image of reality \'97 in the mediation of one or many gods , the fantastic mirror images of human qualities \'97 but now finds it directly and without any mediation in the love between \'93I\'94 and \'93Thou\'94  .  Thus , finally , with Feuerbach sex love becomes one of the highest forms , if not the highest form , of the practice of his new religion  . \
Now relations between human beings , based on affection , and especially between the two sexes , have existed as long as mankind has  .  Sex love in particular has undergone a development and won a place during the last 800 years which has made it a compulsory pivotal point of all poetry during this period  .  The existing positive religions have limited themselves to the bestowal of a higher consecration upon state-regulated sex love \'97 that is , upon the marriage laws \'97 and they could all disappear tomorrow without changing in the slightest the practice of love and friendship  .  Thus the Christian religion in France , as a matter of fact , so completely disappeared in the year 1793\'9695 that even Napoleon could not re-introduce it without opposition and difficulty ; and this without any need for a substitute in Feuerbach\'92s sense , making itself in the interval  . \
Feuerbach\'92s idealism consists here in this  : he does not simply accept mutual relations based on reciprocal inclination between human beings , such as sex love , friendship , compassion , self-sacrifice , etc  .  , as what they are in themselves \'97 without associating them with any particular religion which to him , too , belongs to the past ; but instead he asserts that they will attain their full value only when consecrated by the name of religion  .  The chief thing for him is not that these purely human relations exist , but that they shall be conceived of as the new , true , religion  .  They are to have full value only after they have been marked with a religious stamp  .  Religion is derived from\'a0religare\'a0 [ \'93to bind\'94 ] and meant , originally , a bond  .  Therefore , every bond between two people is a religion  .  Such etymological tricks are the last resort of idealist philosophy  .  Not what the word means according to the historical development of its actual use , but what it ought to mean according to its derivation is what counts  .  And so sex love , and the intercourse between the sexes , is apotheosized to a\'a0religion , merely in order that the word religion , which is so dear to idealistic memories , may not disappear from the language  .  The Parisian reformers of the Louis Blanc trend used to speak in precisely the same way in the forties  .  They , likewise , could conceive of a man without religion only as a monster , and used to say to us  : \'93Donc , l\'92atheisme c\'92est votre religion  !\'94  [ \'93Well , then atheism is your religion  !\'94 ] If Feuerbach wishes to establish a true religion upon the basis of an essentially materialist conception of nature , that is the same as regarding modern chemistry as true alchemy  .  If religion can exist without its god , alchemy can exist without its philosopher\'92s stone  .  By the way , there exists a very close connection between alchemy and religion  .  The philosopher\'92s stone has many godlike properties and the Egyptian-Greek alchemists of the first two centuries of our era had a hand in the development of Christian doctrines , as the data given by Kopp and Bertholet have proved  . \
Feuerbach\'92s assertion that \'93the periods of humanity are distinguished only by religious changes\'94 is decidedly false  .  Great historical turning-points have been\'a0accompanied\'a0by religious changes only so far as the three world religions which have existed up to the present \'97 Buddhism , Christianity , and Islam \'97 are concerned  .  The old tribal and national religions , which arose spontaneously , did not proselytize and lost all their power of resistance as soon as the independence of the tribe or people was lost  .  For the Germans , it was sufficient to have simple contact with the decaying Roman world empire and with its newly adopted Christian world religion which fitted its economic , political , and ideological conditions  .  Only with these world religions , arisen more or less artificially , particularly Christianity and Islam , do we find that the more general historical movements acquire a religious imprint  .  Even in regard to Christianity , the religious stamp in revolutions of really universal significance is restricted to the first stages of the bourgeoisie\'92s struggle for emancipation \'97 from the 13th to the 17th century \'97 and is to be accounted for , not as Feuerbach thinks by the hearts of men and their religious needs , but by the entire previous history of the Middle Ages , which knew no other form of ideology than religion and theology  .  But when the bourgeoisie of the 18th century was strengthened enough likewise to posses an ideology of its own , suited to its own class standpoint , it made its great and conclusive revolution \'97 the French \'97 , appealing exclusively to juristic and political ideas , and troubling itself with religion only in so far as it stood in its way  .  But it never occurred to it to put a new religion in place of the old  .  Everyone knows how Robespierre failed in his attempt  [ to set up a religion of the \'93highest being\'94 ]  . \
The possibility of purely human sentiments in our intercourse with other human beings has nowadays been sufficiently curtailed by the society in which we must live , which is based upon class antagonism and class rule  .  We have no reason to curtail it still more by exalting these sentiments to a religion  .  And similarly the understanding of the great historical class struggles has already been sufficiently obscured by current historiography , particularly in Germany , so that there is also no need for us to make such an understanding totally impossible by transforming the history of these struggles into a mere appendix of ecclesiastical history  .  Already here it becomes evident how far today we have moved beyond Feuerbach  .  His \'93finest\'94 passages in glorification of his new religion of love are totally unreadable today  . \
The only religion which Feuerbach examines seriously is Christianity , the world religion of the Occident , based upon monotheism  .  He proves that the Christian god is only a fantastic reflection , a mirror image , of man  .  Now , this god is , however , himself the product of a tedious process of abstraction , the concentrated quintessence of the numerous earlier tribal and national gods  .  And man , whose image this god is , is therefore also not a real man , but likewise the quintessence of the numerous real men , man in the abstract , therefore himself again a mental image  .  Feuerbach , who on every page preaches sensuousness , absorption in the concrete , in actuality , becomes thoroughly abstract as soon as he begins to talk of any other than mere sex relations between human beings  . \
Of these relations , only one aspect appeals to him  : morality  .  And here we are again struck by Feuerbach\'92s astonishing poverty when compared to Hegel  .  The latter\'92s ethics , or doctrine of moral conduct , is the philosophy of right , and embraces  : (  1  ) abstract right ; (  2  ) morality ; (  3  ) social ethics  [ Sittlichkeit ] , under which are comprised  : the family , civil society , and the state  . \
Here the content is as realistic as the form is idealistic  .  Besides morality , the whole sphere of law , economy , politics is here included  .  With Feuerbach , it is just the reverse  .  In the form he is realistic since he takes his start from man ; but there is absolutely no mention of the world in which this man lives ; hence , this man remains always the same abstract man who occupied the field in the philosophy of religion  .  For this man is not born of woman ; he issues , as from a chrysalis , from the god of monotheistic religions  .  He therefore does not live in a real world historically come into being and historically determined  .  True , he has intercourse with other men ; however , each one of them is just as much an abstraction as he himself  .  In his philosophy of religion we still had men and women , but in his ethics even this last distinction disappears  .  Feuerbach , to be sure , at long intervals makes such statements as  : \'93Man thinks differently in a palace and in a hut  . \'94 \'93If because of hunger , of misery , you have no stuff in your body , you likewise have no stuff for morality in your head , in your mind , or heart  . \'94 \'93Politics must become our religion ,\'94 etc  . \
But Feuerbach is absolutely incapable of achieving anything with these maxims  .  They remain mere phrases , and even Starcke has to admit that for Feuerbach politics constituted an impassable frontier and the \'93science of society , sociology , was\'a0terra incognita\'a0to him\'94  . \
He appears just as shallow , in comparison with Hegel , in his treatment of the antithesis of good and evil  . \
\'93One believes one is saying something great ,\'94 Hegel remarks , \'93if one says that \'91man is naturally good\'92  .  But one forgets that one says something far greater when one says \'91man is naturally evil\'92  . \'94\
With Hegel , evil is the form in which the motive force of historical development presents itself  .  This contains the twofold meaning that , on the one hand , each new advance necessarily appears as a sacrilege against things hallowed , as a rebellion against condition , though old and moribund , yet sanctified by custom ; and that , on the other hand , it is precisely the wicked passions of man \'97 greed and lust for power \'97 which , since the emergence of class antagonisms , serve as levers of historical development \'97 a fact of which the history of feudalism and of the bourgeoisie , for example , constitutes a single continual proof  .  But it does not occur to Feuerbach to investigate the historical role of moral evil  .  To him , history is altogether an uncanny domain in which he feels ill at ease  .  Even his dictum  : \'93Man as he sprang originally from nature was only a mere creature of nature , not a man  .  Man is a product of man , of culture , of history\'94 \'97 with him , even this dictum remains absolutely sterile  . \
What Feuerbach has to tell us about morals can , therefore , only be extremely meagre  .  The urge towards happiness is innate in man , and must therefore form the basis of all morality  .  But the urge towards happiness is subject to a double correction  .  First , by the natural consequences of our actions  : after the debauch comes the \'93blues\'94 , and habitual excess is followed by illness  .  Secondly , by its social consequences  : if we do not respect the similar urge of other people towards happiness they will defend themselves , and so interfere with our own urge toward happiness  .  Consequently , in order to satisfy our urge , we must be in a position to appreciate rightly the results of our conduct and must likewise allow others an equal right to seek happiness  .  Rational self-restraint with regard to ourselves , and love \'97 again and again love  ! \'97 in our intercourse with others \'97 these are the basic laws of Feuerbach\'92s morality ; from them , all others are derived  .  And neither the most spirited utterances of Feuerbach nor the strongest eulogies of Starcke can hide the tenuity and banality of these few propositions  . \
Only very exceptionally , and by no means to this and other people\'92s profit , can an individual satisfy his urge towards happiness by preoccupation with himself  .  Rather , it requires preoccupation with the outside world , with means to satisfy his needs \'97 that is to say , food , an individual of the opposite sex , books , conversation , argument , activities , objects for use and working up  .  Feuerbach\'92s morality either presupposes that these means and objects of satisfaction are given to every individual as a matter of course , or else it offers only inapplicable good advice and is , therefore , not worth a brass farthing to people who are without these means  .  And Feuerbach himself states this in plain terms  :\
\'93Man thinks differently in a palace and in a hut  .  If because of hunger , of misery , you have no stuff in your body , you likewise have no stuff for morality in your head , in your mind , or heart  . \'94\
Do matters fare any better in regard to the equal right of others to satisfy their urge towards happiness  ? Feuerbach posed this claim as absolute , as holding good for all times and circumstances  .  But since when has it been valid  ? Was there ever in antiquity between slaves and masters , or in the Middle Ages between serfs and barons , any talk about an equal right to the urge towards happiness  ? Was not the urge towards happiness of the oppressed class sacrificed ruthlessly and \'93by the right of law\'94 to that of the ruling class  ? Yes , that was indeed immoral ; nowadays , however , equality of rights is recognized  .  Recognized in words ever since and inasmuch as the bourgeoisie , in its fight against feudalism and in the development of capitalist production , was compelled to abolish all privileges of estate , that is , personal privileges , and to introduce the equality of all individuals before law , first in the sphere in private law , then gradually also in the sphere of public law  .  But the urge towards happiness thrives only to a trivial extent on ideal rights  .  To the greatest extent of all it thrives on material means ; and capitalist production takes care to ensure that the great majority of those equal rights shall get only what is essential for bare existence  .  Capitalist production has , therefore , little more respect , if indeed any more , for the equal right to the urge towards happiness of the majority than had slavery or serfdom  .  And are we better off in regard to the mental means of happiness , the educational means  ? Is not even \'93the schoolmaster of Sadowa\'94 a mythical person  ?\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch03.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}}\
More  .  According to Feuerbach\'92s theory of morals , the Stock Exchange is the highest temple of moral conduct , provided only that one always speculates right  .  If my urge towards happiness leads me to the Stock Exchange , and if there I correctly gauge the consequences of my actions so that only agreeable results and no disadvantages ensue \'97 that is , I always win \'97 then I am fulfilling Feuerbach\'92s precept  .  Moreover , I do not thereby interfere with the equal right of another person to pursue his happiness ; for that other man went to the Exchange just as voluntarily as I did and in concluding the speculative transaction with me he has followed his urge towards happiness as I have followed mine  .  If he loses his money , his action is ipso facto proved to have been unethical , because of his bad reckoning , and since I have given him the punishment he deserves , I can even slap my chest proudly , like a modern Rhadamanthus  .  Love , too , rules on the Stock Exchange , in so far as it is not simply a sentimental figure of speech , for each finds in others the satisfaction of his own urge towards happiness , which is just what love ought to achieve and how it acts in practice  .  And if I gamble with correct prevision of the consequences of my operations , and therefore with success , I fulfil all the strictest injunctions of Feuerbachian morality \'97 and becomes a rich man into the bargain  .  In other words , Feuerbach\'92s morality is cut exactly to the pattern of modern capitalist society , little as Feuerbach himself might desire or imagine it  . \
But love  ! \'97 yes , with Feuerbach , love is everywhere and at all times the wonder-working god who should help to surmount all difficulties of practical life \'97 and at that in a society which is split into classes with diametrically opposite interests  .  At this point , the last relic of the revolutionary character disappears from his philosophy , leaving only the old cant  : Love one another \'97 fall into each other\'92s arms regardless of distinctions of sex or estate \'97 a universal orgy of reconciliation  !\
In short , the Feuerbachian theory of morals fares like all its predecessors  .  It is designed to suit all periods , all peoples and all conditions , and precisely for that reason it is never and nowhere applicable  .  It remains , as regards the real world , as powerless as Kant\'92s categorical imperative  .  In reality every class , even every profession , has its own morality , and even this it violates whenever it can do so with impunity  .  And love , which is to unite all , manifests itself in wars , altercations , lawsuits , domestic broils , divorces , and every possible exploitation of one by another  . \
Now how was it possible that the powerful impetus given by Feuerbach turned out to be so unfruitful for himself  ? For the simple reason that Feuerbach himself never contrives to escape from the realm of abstraction \'97 for which he has a deadly hatred \'97 into that of living reality  .  He clings fiercely to nature and man ; but nature and man remain mere words with him  .  He is incapable of telling us anything definite either about real nature or real men  .  But from the abstract man of Feuerbach , one arrives at real living men only when one considers them as participants in history  .  And that is what Feuerbach resisted ,and therefore the year 1848 , which he did not understand , meant to him merely the final break with the real world , retirement into solitude  .  The blame for this again falls chiefly on the conditions them obtaining in Germany , which condemned him to rot away miserably  . \
But the step which Feuerbach did not take nevertheless had to be taken  .  The cult of abstract man , which formed the kernel of Feuerbach\'92s new religion , had to be replaced by the science of real men and of their historical development  .  This further development of Feuerbach\'92s standpoint beyond Feuerbach was inaugurated by Marx in 1845 in\'a0The Holy Family  . \
Strauss , Bauer , Stirner , Feuerbach \'97 these were the offshoots of Hegelian philosophy , in so far as they did not abandon the field of philosophy  .  Strauss , after his\'a0Life of Jesus\'a0and\'a0Dogmatics , produced only literary studies in philosophy and ecclesiastical history after the fashion of Renan  .  Bauer only achieved something in the field of the history of the origin of Christianity , though what he did here was important  .  Stirner remained a curiosity , even after Bakunin blended him with Proudhon and labelled the blend \'93anarchism\'94  .  Feuerbach alone was of significance as a philosopher  .  But not only did philosophy \'97 claimed to soar above all special sciences and to be the science of sciences connecting them \'97 remain to him an impassable barrier , an inviolable holy thing , but as a philosopher , too , he stopped half-incapable of disposing of Hegel through criticism ; he simply threw him aside as useless , while he himself , compared with the encyclopaedic wealth of the Hegelian system , achieved nothing positive beyond a turgid religion of love and a meagre , impotent morality  . \
Out of the dissolution of the Hegelian school , however , there developed still another tendency , the only one which has borne real fruit  .  And this tendency is essentially connected with the name of Marx\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch04.htm#1"}}{\fldrslt (  1  )}}  . \
The separation from Hegelian philosophy was here also the result of a return to the materialist standpoint  .  That means it was resolved to comprehend the real world \'97 nature and history \'97 just as it presents itself to everyone who approaches it free from preconceived idealist crotchets  .  It was decided mercilessly to sacrifice every idealist fancy which could not be brought into harmony with the facts conceived in their own and not in a fantastic interconnection  .  And materialism means nothing more than this  .  But here the materialistic world outlook was taken really seriously for the first time and was carried through consistently \'97 at least in its basic features \'97 in all domains of knowledge concerned  . \
Hegel was not simply put aside  .  On the contrary , a start was made from his revolutionary side , described above , from the dialectical method  .  But in its Hegelian form , this method was unusable  .  According to Hegel , dialectics is the self-development of the concept  .  The absolute concept does not only exist \'97 unknown where \'97 from eternity , it is also the actual living soul of the whole existing world  .  It develops into itself through all the preliminary stages which are treated at length in the\'a0Logic\'a0and which are all included in it  .  Then it \'93alienates\'94 itself by changing into nature , where , unconscious of itself , disguised as a natural necessity , it goes through a new development and finally returns as man\'92s consciousness of himself  .  This self-consciousness then elaborates itself again in history in the crude form until finally the absolute concept again comes to itself completely in the Hegelian philosophy  .  According to Hegel , therefore , the dialectical development apparent in nature and history \'97 that is , the causal interconnection of the progressive movement from the lower to the higher , which asserts itself through all zigzag movements and temporary retrogression \'97 is only a copy  [ Abklatsch ] of the self-movement of the concept going on from eternity , no one knows where , but at all events independently of any thinking human brain  .  This ideological perversion had to be done away with  .  We again took a materialistic view of the thoughts in our heads , regarding them as images  [ Abbilder ] of real things instead of regarding real things as images of this or that stage of the absolute concept  .  Thus dialectics reduced itself to the science of the general laws of motion , both of the external world and of human thought \'97 two sets of laws which are identical in substance , but differ in their expression in so far as the human mind can apply them consciously , while in nature and also up to now for the most part in human history , these laws assert themselves unconsciously , in the form of external necessity , in the midst of an endless series of seeming accidents  .  Thereby the dialectic of concepts itself became merely the conscious reflex of the dialectical motion of the real world and thus the dialectic of Hegel was turned over ; or rather , turned off its head , on which it was standing , and placed upon its feet  .  And this materialist dialectic , which for years has been our best working tool and our sharpest weapon , was , remarkably enough , discovered not only by us but also , independently of us and even of Hegel , by a German worker , Joseph Dietzgen  . \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch04.htm#2"}}{\fldrslt (  2  )}}\
In this way , however , the revolutionary side of Hegelian philosophy was again taken up and at the same time freed from the idealist trimmings which with Hegel had prevented its consistent execution  .  The great basic thought that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of readymade\'a0things , but as a complex of\'a0processes , in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads , the concepts , go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away , in which , in spite of all seeming accidentally and of all temporary retrogression , a progressive development asserts itself in the end \'97 this great fundamental thought has , especially since the time of Hegel , so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever contradicted  .  But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two different things  .  If , however , investigation always proceeds from this standpoint , the demand for final solutions and eternal truths ceases once for all ; one is always conscious of the necessary limitation of all acquired knowledge , of the fact that it is conditioned by the circumstances in which it was acquired  .  On the other hand , one no longer permits oneself to be imposed upon by the antithesis , insuperable for the still common old metaphysics , between true and false , good and bad , identical and different , necessary and accidental  .  One knows that these antitheses have only a relative validity ; that that which is recognized now as true has also its latent false side which will later manifest itself , just as that which is now regarded as false has also its true side by virtue of which it could previously be regarded as true  .  One knows that what is maintained to be necessary is composed of sheer accidents and that the so-called accidental is the form behind which necessity hides itself \'97 and so on  . \
The old method of investigation and thought which Hegel calls \'93metaphysical\'94 , which preferred to investigate\'a0things\'a0as given , as fixed and stable , a method the relics of which still strongly haunt people\'92s minds , had a great deal of historical justification in its day  .  It was necessary first to examine things before it was possible to examine processes  .  One had first to know what a particular thing was before one could observe the changes it was undergoing  .  And such was the case with natural science  .  The old metaphysics , which accepted things as finished objects , arose from a natural science which investigated dead and living things as finished objects  .  But when this investigation had progressed so far that it became possible to take the decisive step forward , that is , to pass on the systematic investigation of the changes which these things undergo in nature itself , then the last hour of the old metaphysic struck in the realm of philosophy also  .  And in fact , while natural science up to the end of the last century was predominantly a\'a0collecting\'a0science , a science of finished things , in our century it is essentially a systematizing science , a science of the processes , of the origin and development of these things and of the interconnection which binds all these natural processes into one great whole  .  Physiology , which investigates the processes occurring in plant and animal organisms ; embryology , which deals with the development of individual organisms from germs to maturity ; geology , which investigates the gradual formation of the Earth\'92s surface \'97 all these are the offspring of our century  . \
But , above all , there are three great discoveries which have enabled our knowledge of the interconnection of natural processes to advance by leaps and bounds  :\
First , the discovery of the cell as the unit from whose multiplication and differentiation the whole plant and animal body develops  .  Not only is the development and growth of all higher organisms recognized to proceed according to a single general law , but the capacity of the cell to change indicates the way by which organisms can change their species and thus go through a more than individual development  . \
Second , the transformation of energy , which has demonstrated to us that all the so-called forces operative in the first instance in inorganic nature \'97 mechanical force and its complement , so-called potential energy , heat , radiation (  light , or radiant heat  ) , electricity , magnetism , and chemical energy \'97 are different forms of manifestation of universal motion , which pass into one another in definite proportions so that in place of a certain quantity of the one which disappears , a certain quantity of another makes its appearance and thus the whole motion of nature is reduced to this incessant process of transformation from one form into another  . \
Finally , the proof which Darwin first developed in connected form that the stock of organic products of nature environing us today , including man , is the result of a long process of evolution from a few originally unicellular germs , and that these again have arisen from protoplasm or albumen , which came into existence by chemical means  . \
Thanks to these three great discoveries , and the other immense advances in natural science , we have now arrived at the point where we can demonstrate the interconnection between the processes in nature not only in particular spheres but also the interconnection of these particular spheres on the whole , and so can present in an approximately systematic form a comprehensive view of the interconnection in nature by means of the facts provided by an empirical science itself  .  To furnish this comprehensive view was formerly the task of so-called natural philosophy  .  It could do this only by putting in place of the real but as yet unknown interconnections ideal , fancied ones , filling in the missing facts by figments of the mind and bridging the actual gaps merely in imagination  .  In the course of this procedure it conceived many brilliant ideas and foreshadowed many later discoveries , but it also produced a considerable amount of nonsense , which indeed could not have been otherwise  .  Today , when one needs to comprehend the results of natural scientific investigation only dialetically , that is , in the sense of their own interconnection , in order to arrive at a \'93system of nature\'94 sufficient for our time ; when the dialectical character of this interconnection is forcing itself against their will even into the metaphysically-trained minds of the natural scientists , today natural philosophy is finally disposed of  .  Every attempt at resurrecting it would be not only superfluous but a\'a0step backwards  . \
But what is true of nature , which is hereby recognized also as a historical process of development , is likewise true of the history of society in all its branches and of the totality of all sciences which occupy themselves with things human (  and divine  )  .  Here , too , the philosophy of history , of right , of religion , etc  .  , has consisted in the substitution of an interconnection fabricated in the mind of the philosopher for the real interconnection to be demonstrated in the events ; has consisted in the comprehension of history as a whole as well as in its separate parts , as the gradual realization of ideas \'97 and naturally always only the pet ideas of the philosopher himself  .  According to this , history worked unconsciously but of necessity towards a certain ideal goal set in advance \'97 as , for example , in Hegel , towards the realization of his absolute idea \'97 and the unalterable trend towards this absolute idea formed the inner interconnection in the events of history  .  A new mysterious providence \'97 unconscious or gradually coming into consciousness \'97 was thus put in the place of the real , still unknown interconnection  .  Here , therefore , just as in the realm of nature , it was necessary to do away with these fabricated , artificial interconnections by the discovery of the real ones \'97 a task which ultimately amounts to the discovery of the general laws of motion which assert themselves as the ruling ones in the history of human society  . \
In one point , however , the history of the development of society proves to be essentially different from that of nature  .  In nature \'97 in so far as we ignore man\'92s reaction upon nature \'97 there are only blind , unconscious agencies acting upon one another , out of whose interplay the general law comes into operation  .  Nothing of all that happens \'97 whether in the innumerable apparent accidents observable upon the surface , or in the ultimate results which confirm the regularity inherent in these accidents \'97 happens as a consciously desired aim  .  In the history of society , on the contrary , the actors are all endowed with consciousness , are men acting with deliberation or passion , working towards definite goals ; nothing happens without a conscious purpose , without an intended aim  .  But this distinction , important as it is for historical investigation , particularly of single epochs and events , cannot alter the fact that the course of history is governed by inner general laws  .  For here , also , on the whole , in spite of the consciously desired aims of all individuals , accident apparently reigns on the surface  .  That which is willed happens but rarely ; in the majority of instances the numerous desired ends cross and conflict with one another , or these ends themselves are from the outset incapable of realization , or the means of attaining them are insufficient  .  thus the conflicts of innumerable individual wills and individual actions in the domain of history produce a state of affairs entirely analogous to that prevailing in the realm of unconscious nature  .  The ends of the actions are intended , but the results which actually follow from these actions are not intended ; or when they do seem to correspond to the end intended , they ultimately have consequences quite other than those intended  .  Historical events thus appear on the whole to be likewise governed by chance  .  But where on the surface accident holds sway , there actually it is always governed by inner , hidden laws , and it is only a matter of discovering these laws  . \
Men make their own history , whatever its outcome may be , in that each person follows his own consciously desired end , and it is precisely the resultant of these many wills operating in different directions , and of their manifold effects upon the outer world , that constitutes history  .  Thus it is also a question of what the many individuals desire  .  The will is determined by passion or deliberation  .  But the levers which immediately determine passion or deliberation are of very different kinds  .  Partly they may be external objects , partly ideal motives , ambition , \'93enthusiasm for truth and justice\'94 , personal hatred , or even purely individual whims of all kinds  .  But , on the one hand , we have seen that the many individual wills active in history for the most part produce results quite other than those intended \'97 often quite the opposite ; that their motives , therefore , in relation to the total result are likewise of only secondary importance  .  On the other hand , the further question arises  : What driving forces in turn stand behind these motives  ? What are the historical forces which transform themselves into these motives in the brains of the actors  ?\
The old materialism never put this question to itself  .  Its conception of history , in so far as it has one at all , is therefore essentially pragmatic ; it divides men who act in history into noble and ignoble and then finds that as a rule the noble are defrauded and the ignoble are victorious  .  hence , it follows for the old materialism that nothing very edifying is to be got from the study of history , and for us that in the realm of history the old materialism becomes untrue to itself because it takes the ideal driving forces which operate there as ultimate causes , instead of investigating what is behind them , what are the driving forces of these driving forces  .  This inconsistency does not lie in the fact that\'a0ideal\'a0driving forces are recognized , but in the investigation not being carried further back behind these into their motive causes  .  On the other hand , the philosophy of history , particularly as represented by Hegel , recognizes that the ostensible and also the really operating motives of men who act in history are by no means the ultimate causes of historical events ; that behind these motives are other motive powers , which have to be discovered  .  But it does not seek these powers in history itself , it imports them rather from outside , from philosophical ideology , into history  .  Hegel , for example , instead of explaining the history of ancient Greece out of its own inner interconnections , simply maintains that it is nothing more than the working out of \'93forms of beautiful individuality\'94 , the realization of a \'93work of art\'94 as such  .  He says much in this connection about the old Greeks that is fine and profound , but that does not prevent us today from refusing to be put off with such an explanation , which is a mere manner of speech  . \
When , therefore , it is a question of investigating the driving powers which \'97 consciously or unconsciously , and indeed very often unconsciously \'97 lie behind the motives of men who act in history and which constitute the real ultimate driving forces of history , then it is not a question so much of the motives of single individuals , however eminent , as of those motives which set in motion great masses , whole people , and again whole classes of the people in each people ; and this , too , not merely for an instant , like the transient flaring up of a straw-fire which quickly dies down , but as a lasting action resulting in a great historical transformation  .  To ascertain the driving causes which here in the minds of acting masses and their leaders \'97 to so-called great men \'97 are reflected as conscious motives , clearly or unclearly , directly or in an ideological , even glorified , form \'97 is the only path which can put us on the track of the laws holding sway both in history as a whole , and at particular periods and in particular lands  .  Everything which sets men in motion must go through their minds ; but what form it will take in the mind will depend very much upon the circumstances  .  The workers have by no means become reconciled to capitalist machine industry , even though they no longer simply break the machines to pieces , as they still did in 1848 on the Rhine  . \
But while in all earlier periods the investigation of these driving causes of history was almost impossible \'97 on account of the complicated and concealed interconnections between them and their effects \'97 our present period has so far simplified these interconnections that the riddle could be solved  .  Since the establishment of large-scale industry \'97 that is , at least since the European peace of 1815 \'97 it has been no longer a secret to any man in England that the whole political struggle there pivoted on the claims to supremacy of two classes  : the landed aristocracy and the bourgeoisie (  middle class  )  .  In France , with the return of the Bourbons , the same fact was perceived , the historians of the Restoration period , from Thierry to Guisot , Mignet , and Thiers , speak of it everywhere as the key to the understanding of all French history since the Middle Ages  .  And since 1830 , the working class , the proletariat , has been recognized in both countries as a third competitor for power  .  Conditions had become so simplified that one would have had to close one\'92s eyes deliberately not to see in the light of these three great classes and in the conflict of their interests the driving force of modern history \'97 at least in the two most advanced countries  . \
But how did these classes come into existence  ? If it was possible at first glance still to ascribe the origin of the great , formerly feudal landed property \'97 at least in the first instance \'97 to political causes , to taking possession by force , this could not be done in regard to the bourgeoise and the proletariat  .  Here , the origin and development of two great classes was seen to lie clearly and palpably in purely economic causes  .  And it was just as clear that in the struggle between landed property and the bourgeoisie , no less than in the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat , it was a question , first and foremost , of economic interests , to the furtherance of which political power was intended to serve merely as a means  .  Bourgeoisie and proletariat both arose in consequences of a transformation of the economic conditions , more precisely , of the mode of production  .  The transition , first from guild handicrafts to manufacture , and then from manufacture to large-scale industry , with steam and mechanical power , had caused the development of these two classes  .  At a certain stage , the new productive forces set in motion by the bourgeoisie \'97 in the first place the division of labor and the combination of many detail laborers  [ Teilarbeiter ] in one general manufactory \'97 and the conditions and requirements of exchange , developed through these productive forces , became incompatible with the existing order of production handed down by history and sanctified by law \'97 that is to say , incompatible with the privileges of the guild and the numerous other personal and local privileges (  which were only so many fetters to the unprivileged estates  ) of the feudal order to society  .  The productive forces represented by the bourgeoisie rebelled against the order of production represented by the feudal landlords and the guild-masters  .  The result is known , the feudal fetters were smashed , gradually in England , at one blow in France  .  In Germany , the process is not yet finished  .  But just as , at a definite stage of its development , manufacture came into conflict with the feudal order of production , so now large-scale industry has already come into conflict with the bourgeois order or production established in its place  . Tied down by this order , by the narrow limits of the capitalist mode of production , this industry produces , on the one hand , an ever-increasingly proletarianziation of the great mass of the people , and on the other hand , an ever greater mass of unsalable products  .  Overproduction and mass misery , each the cause of the other \'97 that is the absurd contradiction which is its outcome , and which of necessity calls for the liberation of the productive forces by means of a change in the mode of production  . \
In modern history at least it is , therefore , proved that all political struggles are class struggles , and all class struggles for emancipation , despite their necessarily political form \'97 for every class struggle is a political struggle \'97 turn ultimately on the question of\'a0economic\'a0emancipation  .  Therefore , here at least , the state \'97 the political order \'97 is the subordination , and civil society \'97 the realm of economic relations \'97 the decisive element  .  The traditional conception , to which Hegel , too , pays homage , saw in the state the determining element , and in civil society the element determined by it  .  Appearances correspond to this  .  As all the driving forces of the actions of any individual person must pass through his brain , and transform themselves into motives of his will in order to set him into action , so also all the needs of civil society \'97 no matter which class happens to be the ruling one \'97 must pass through the will of the state in order to secure general validity in the form of laws  .  That is the formal aspect of the matter \'97 the one which is self-evident  .  The question arises , however , what is the content of this merely formal will \'97 of the individual as well as of the state \'97 and whence is this content derived  ? Why is just this willed and not something else  ? If we enquire into this , we discover that in modern history the will of the state is , on the whole , determined by the changing needs of civil society , but the supremacy of this or that class , in the last resort , by the development of the productive forces and relations of exchange  . \
But if even in our modern era , with its gigantic means of production and communication , the state is not an independent domain with an independent development , but one whose existence as well as development is to be explained in the last resort by the economic conditions of life of society , then this must be still more true of all earlier times when the production of the material life of man was not yet carried on with these abundant auxiliary means , and when , therefore , the necessity of such production must have exercised a still greater mastery over men  .  If the state even today , in the era of big industry and of railways , is on the whole only a reflection , in concentrated form , of the economic needs of the class controlling production , then this must have been much more so in an epoch when each generation of men was forced to spend a far greater part of its aggregate lifetime in satisfying material needs , and was therefore much more dependent on them than we are today  .  An examination of the history of earlier periods , as soon as it is seriously undertaken from this angle , most abundantly confirms this  .  But , of course , this cannot be gone into here  . \
If the state and public law are determined by economic relations , so , too , of course , is private law , which indeed in essence only sanctions the existing economic relations between individuals which are normal in the given circumstances  .  The form in which this happens can , however , vary considerably  .  It is possible , as happened in England , in harmony with the whole national development , to retain in the main the forms of the old feudal laws while giving them a bourgeois content ; in fact , directly reading a bourgeois meaning into the feudal name  .  But , also , as happened in Western continental Europe , roman law , the first world law of a commodity-producing society , with its unsurpassably fine elaboration of all the essential legal relations of simple commodity owners (  of buyers and sellers , debtors and creditors , contracts , obligations , etc  .   ) can be taken as the foundation  .  In which case , for the benefit of a still petty-bourgeois and semi-feudal society , it can either be reduced to the level of such a society simply through judicial practice (  common law  ) or , with the help of allegedly enlightened , moralizing jurists it can be worked into a special code of law to correspond with such social level \'97 a code which in these circumstances will be a bad one also from the legal standpoint (  for instance , Prussian Landrecht  )  .  But after a great bourgeois revolution it is , however , also possible for such a classic law code of bourgeois society as the French\'a0Code Civile\'a0to be worked out upon the basis of this same Roman Law  .  If , therefore , bourgeois legal rules merely express the economic life conditions of society in legal form , then they can do so well or ill according to circumstances  . \
The state presents itself to us as the first ideological power over man  .  Society creates for itself an organ for the safeguarding of its common interests against internal and external attacks  .  This organ is the state power  .  Hardly come into being , this organ makes itself independent vis-a-vis society ; and , indeed , the more so , the more it becomes the organ of a particular class , the more it directly enforces the supremacy of that class  .  The fight of the oppressed class against the ruling class becomes necessarily a political fight , a fight first of all against the political dominance of this class  .  The consciousness of the interconnection between this political struggle and its economic basis becomes dulled and can be lost altogether  .  While this is not wholly the case with the participants , it almost always happens with the historians  .  Of the ancient sources on the struggles within the Roman Republic , only Appian tells us clearly and distinctly what was at issue in the last resort \'97 namely , landed property  . \
But once the state has become an independent power vis-a-vis society , it produces forthwith a further ideology  .  It is indeed among professional politicians , theorists of public law , and jurists of private law , that the connection with economic facts gets lost for fair  .  Since in each particular case , the economic facts must assume the form of juristic motives in order to receive legal sanction ; and since , in so doing , consideration of course has to be given to the whole legal system already in operation , the juristic form is , in consequence , made everything and the economic content nothing  .  Public law and private law are treated as independent spheres , each being capable of and needing a systematic presentation by the consistent elimination of all inner contradictions  . \
Still higher ideologies , that is , such as are still further removed from the material , economic basis , take the form of philosophy and religion  .  Here the interconnection between conceptions and their material conditions of existence becomes more and more complicated , more and more obscured by intermediate links  .  But the interconnection exists  .  Just as the whole Renaissance period , from the middle of the 15th century , was an essential product of the towns and , therefore , of the burghers , so also was the subsequently newly-awakened philosophy  .  Its content was in essence only the philosophical expression of the thoughts corresponding to the development of the small and middle burghers into a big bourgeoisie  .  Among last century\'92s Englishmen and Frenchmen who in many cases were just as much political economists as philosophers , this is clearly evident ; and we have proved it above in regard to the Hegelian school  . \
We will now in addition deal only briefly with religion , since the latter stands further away from material life and seems to be most alien to it  .  Religion arose in very primitive times from erroneous , primitive conceptions of men about their own nature and external nature surrounding them  .  Every ideology , however , once it has arisen , develops in connection with the given concept-material , and develops this material further ; otherwise , it would not be an ideology , that is , occupation with thoughts as with independent entities , developing independently and subject only to their own laws  .  In the last analysis , the material life conditions of the persons inside whose heads this thought process goes on determine the course of the process , which of necessity remains unknown to these persons , for otherwise there would be an end to all ideology  .  These original religious notions , therefore , which in the main are common to each group of kindred peoples , develop , after the group separates , in a manner peculiar to each people , according to the conditions of life falling to their lot  .  For a number of groups of peoples , and particularly for the Aryans (  so-called Indo-Europeans  ) this process has been shown in detail by comparative mythology  .  The gods thus fashioned within each people were national gods , whose domain extended no farther than the national territory which they were to protect ; on the other side of its boundaries , other gods held undisputed sway  .  They could continue to exist , in imagination , only as long as the nation existed ; they fell with its fall  .  The Roman world empire , the economic conditions of whose origin we do not need to examine here , brought about this downfall of the old nationalities  .  The old national gods decayed , even those of the Romans , which also were patterned to suit only the narrow confines of the city of Rome  .  The need to complement the world empire by means of a world religion was clearly revealed in the attempts made to recognize all foreign gods that were the least bit respectable and provide altars for them in Rome alongside the native gods  .  But a new world religion is not to be made in this fashion , by imperial decree  .  The new world religion , Christianity , had already quietly come into being , out of a mixture of generalized Oriental , particularly Jewish , theology , and vulgarized Greek , particularly Stoic , philosophy  .  What it originally looked like has to be first laboriously discovered , since its official form , as it has been handed down to us , is merely that in which it became the state religion to which purpose it was adapted by the Council of Nicaea  .  The fact that already after 250 years it became the state religion suffices to show that it was the religion in correspondence with the conditions of the time  .  In the Middle Ages , in the same measure as feudalism developed , Christianity grew into the religious counterpart to it , with a corresponding feudal hierarchy  .  And when the burghers began to thrive , there developed , in opposition to feudal Catholicism , the Protestant heresy , which first appeared in Southern France among the Albigenses{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch04.htm#A"}}{\fldrslt  [ A ]}} , at the time the cities there reached the highest point of their florescence  .  The Middle Ages had attached to theology all the other forms of ideology \'97 philosophy , politics , jurisprudence \'97 and made them subdivision of theology  .  It thereby constrained every social and political movement to take on a theological form  .  The sentiments of the masses were fed with religion to the exclusion of all else ; it was therefore necessary to put forward their own interests in a religious guise in order to produce a great tempest  .  And just as the burghers from the beginning brought into being an appendage of propertyless urban plebeians , day laborers and servants of all kinds , belonging to no recognized social estate , precursors of the later proletariat , so likewise heresy soon became divided into a burgher-moderate heresy and a plebeian-revolutionary one , the latter an abomination to the burgher heretics themselves  . \
The ineradicability of the Protestant heresy corresponded to the invincibility of the rising burghers  .  When these burghers had become sufficiently strengthened , their struggle against the feudal nobility , which till then had been predominantly local , began to assume national dimensions  .  The first great action occurred in Germany \'97 the so-called reformation  .  The burghers were neither powerful enough nor sufficiently developed to be able to unite under their banner the remaining rebellious estates \'97 the plebeians of the towns , the lower nobility , and the peasants on the land  .  At first , the nobles were defeated ; the peasants rose in a revolt which formed the peak of the whole revolutionary struggle ; the cities left them in the lurch , and thus the revolution succumbed to the armies of the secular princes who reaped the whole profit  .  Thenceforward , Germany disappears for three centuries from the ranks of countries playing an independent active part in history  .  But , beside the German Luther appeared the Frenchman Calvin  .  With true French acuity , he put the bourgeois character of the Reformation in the forefront , republicanized and democratized the Church  .  While the Lutheran Reformation in Germany degenerated and reduced the country to rack and ruin , the Calvinist Reformation served as a banner for the republicans in Geneva , in Holland , and in Scotland , freed Holland from Spain and from the German Empire , and provided the ideological costume for the second act of the bourgeois revolution , which was taking place in England  .  Here , Calvinism justified itself as the true religious disguise of the interests of the bourgeoisie of that time , and on this account did not attain full recognition when the revolution ended in 1689 in a compromise between one part of the nobility and the bourgeoisie  .  The English state Church was re-established ; but not in its earlier form of a Catholicism which had the king for its pope , being , instead , strongly Calvinized  .  The old state Church had celebrated the merry Catholic Sunday and had fought against the dull Calvinist one  .  The new , bourgeoisified Church introduced the latter , which adorns England to this day  . \
In France , the Calvinist minority was suppressed in 1685 and either Catholized or driven out of the country  .  But what was the good  ? Already at that time the freethinker Pierre Bayle was at the height of his activity , and in 1694 Voltaire was born  .  The forcible measures of Louis XIV only made it easier for the French bourgeoisie to carry through its revolution in the irreligious , exclusively political form which alone was suited to a developed bourgeoisie  .  Instead of Protestants , freethinkers took their seats in the national assemblies  .  Thereby Christianity entered into its final stage  .  It was incapable of doing any future service to any progressive class as the ideological garb of its aspirations  .  It became more and more the exclusive possession of the ruling classes ; they apply it as a mere means of government , to keep the lower classes within bounds  .  Moreover , each of the different classes uses its own appropriate religion  : the landed nobility \'97 Catholic Jesuitism , or Protestant orthodoxy ; the liberal and radical bourgeoisie \'97 rationalism ; and it makes little difference whether these gentlemen themselves believe in their respective religions or not  . \
We see , therefore  : religion , once formed , always contains traditional material , just as in all ideological domains tradition forms a great conservative force  .  But the transformations which this material undergoes spring from class relations \'97 that is to say , out of the economic relations of the people who execute these transformations  .  And here that is sufficient  . \
In the above , it could only be a question of giving a general sketch of the Marxist conception of history , at most with a few illustrations , as well  .  The proof must be derived from history itself ; and , in this regard , it may be permitted to say that is has been sufficiently furnished in other writings  .  This conception , however , puts an end to philosophy in the realm of history , just as the dialectical conception of nature makes all natural philosophy both unnecessary and impossible  .  It is no longer a question anywhere of inventing interconnections from out of our brains , but of discovering them in the facts  .  For philosophy , which has been expelled from nature and history , there remains only the realm of pure thought , so far as it is left  : the theory of the laws of the thought process itself , logic and dialectics  . \

With the Revolution of 1848 , \'93educated\'94 Germany said farewell to theory and went over to the field of practice  .  Small production and manufacture , based upon manual labor , were superseded by real large-scale industry  .  Germany again appeared on the world market  .  The new little German Empire\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch04.htm#B"}}{\fldrslt  [ B ]}}\'a0abolished at least the most crying of the abuses with which this development had been obstructed by the system of petty states , the relics of feudalism , and bureaucratic management  .  But to the same degree that speculation abandoned the philosopher\'92s study in order to set up its temple in the Stock Exchange , educated Germany lost the great aptitude for theory which had been the glory of Germany in the days of its deepest political humiliation \'97 the aptitude for purely scientific investigation , irrespective of whether the result obtained was practically applicable or not , whether likely to offend the police authorities or not  .  Official German natural science , it is true , maintained its position in the front rank , particularly in the field of specialized research  .  But even the American journal\'a0Science\'a0rightly remarks that the decisive advances in the sphere of the comprehensive correlation of particular facts and their generalization into laws are now being made much more in England , instead of , as formerly , in Germany  .  And in the sphere of the historical sciences , philosophy included , the old fearless zeal for theory has now disappeared completely , along with classical philosophy  .  Inane eclecticism and an anxious concern for career and income , descending to the most vulgar job-hunting , occupy its place  .  The official representatives of these sciences have become the undisguised ideologists of the bourgeoisie and the existing state \'97 but at a time when both stand in open antagonism to the working class  . \
Only among the working class does the German aptitude for theory remain unimpaired  .  Here , it cannot be exterminated  .  Here , there is no concern for careers ,for profit-making , or for gracious patronage from above  .  On the contrary , the more ruthlessly and disinterestedly science proceeds the more it finds itself in harmony with the interest and aspirations of the workers  .  The new tendency , which recognized that the key to the understanding of the whole history of society lies in the history of the development of labor , from the outset addressed itself by preference to the working class and here found the response which it neither sought nor expected from officially recognized science  .  The German working-class movement is the inheritor of German classical philosophy  .

\b0\fs24   "  Julia ! Julia where are you ? !  "   Seliph cried out into the void in which he stood .  Looking around proved fruitless as every direction stretched on in complete darkness , as if nothing else existed .  Seliph began to run forward , his feet touching ground but running on nothing as he desperately called out for his dear sister .  He couldn't figure out how they had gotten seperated , only that they were .  He quickly came to stop as a figure emerged from the dark , first blury , but becoming more and more clear by the moment .  His anxieties came to rest as Julia stepped towards him from within the void , smiling kindly in his eyes . \
  "  Oh thank God .  .  . I was worried that someone had kidnapped you or something worse ,  "   Seliph said with a relieving sigh , but Julia said nothing .  All she did was draw closer and closer , as if his words didn't exist .  He gazed into her eyes ; they were cold , almost lifeless with a blank smile accomodating them as she stopped before him .  Slowly reached out for Seliph's hand , grasping onto it and raising it to her chest .  Seliph watched in disbelief as she forced his hand against the her breast through her robe , moaning softly as she grasped his other .  Seliph's face grew hot as he panicked , now trying to move away ; he wasn't sure how to feel as she moved his other hand between her legs , forcing him hand to move up against her .  Loud gasps and awkward moans began to harm Seliph's heart . \
  "  S-Stop that Julia ! I'm your brother ! I don't see you in that way !  "   Seliph cried , trying to pull away once more , only to find himself as stiff as steel .  Her moans and cries grew more and more fierce as she had her way with his hands , now gasping out as if she were a harlot from his touch . \
  "  More .  .  . I need more Seliph .  .  .   "   Julia moaned out , causing Seliph to shoot awake in his bed .  His eyes darted around his moonlighten room ; his body was drenched with sweat , practically turning his sheets into bathroom towel as he gazed around .  He held his hand over his eyes , his body certainly more than awake around his nether region .  He groaned as he slid his hand down his face , throwing his head back into his pillow to stare at the ceiling . \
  "  It's that damned dream again .  .  . why does it haunt me .  .  . do I honestly have feelings for Julia ? No .  .  . that can't be it .  .  . its just a dreadful nightmare and nothing more ,  "   Seliph groaned , quickly dozing off to sleep once again .  The morning came quickly as he attempted to gain more rest , leaving him in a perpetual state of being tired and lifeless as he equipped his uniform the next day .  He gazed in his personal mirror as he tied back his hair , sighing heavily with every inch of effort he had to use . \
  "  I look ghastly again this morning .  .  .   "   Seliph sighed , shaking his head as he grabbed his blade .  Today was a special day since the army had gathered many orbs after a raid on one of Bruno's strongholds .  The whole barracks was in a commotion , leaving Seliph to feel a bit out of place as he dragged his rear to the main courtyard .  The first face he saw was a pleseantly familiar one as he tredged to the loud commotion .  Eldigan could be seen standing off to the side as if trying to hide his presence from the rest of the mob of heroes that gladly gathered to together .  Eldigan raised his eyes to see the dreadful expression of his Lord Seliph droneing in his direction . \
  "  Good morning , Lord Seliph .  You look a bit dichiveled this morning , is something troubling you ?  "   Eldigan inquired as Seliph let loose an obnoxiously long yawn .  It was quite clear to Eldigan that Seliph's sleeping schedule was in complete chaos , clearly taking a toll on not only his physical body , but his personal morale as well . \
  "  Morning Eldigan .  .  . my nightmares seems to be haunting more frequently night to night .  But its nothing for you to seriously concern yourself with ,  "   Seliph said , yawning again against his will as stretched out his limbs . \
  "  Is it about Julia my lord ?  "   Eldigan said with a smirk , watching Seliph roll his eyes as he leaned up against the same wall as Eldigan . \
  "  Every dream its like she becomes more and more bold with her actions .  Tell me Eldigan , do you think it strange that I have dreams of a physical nature with my own sister ?  "   Seliph groaned , shifting his wary eyes to Eldigan's . \
  "  I'm not one to judge my lord , but if I recall correctly she's only your half sister is she not ?  "   Eldigan asked .  The two of them had plenty of time to talk over the course of their arrival in the barracks ; talking of things that only those who are truly kin would normally converse .  Seeing that none of Seliph's family is currently present within Askr , Eldigan is the closest thing he has to a brother . \
  "  Yeah she is , but I haven't ever thought of her as anything more than just a sister .  We've known each other for some time and I'm pretty sure I would've noticed any feelings developing of that nature between us ,  "   Seliph said , cutting into the topic like a sword in his response .  Eldigan simply shrugged his shoulders , popping his neck as he rested his eyes . \
  "  The heart is a fickled mistress my lord ; many a times has mine wandered into the arms of another .  If Julia is the one to which your heart yearns for , feel fortunate that it is with someone to whome you can trust .  You and Julia are emperor and empress anyways so it wouldn't come off as strange to anyone .  Besides , for what its worth my lord , I believe Julia would make a beautiful bride for you ,  "   Eldigan left Seliph's side with a smirk , turning the corner to join the masses .  Seliph sighed , his eyes tilting towards the cieling as he took Elidgan's words to heart . \
  "  A beautiful bride for me huh .  I guess I'll never know unless Julia is summoned into this world ,  "   Seliph let loose a sight before taking his leave and joining Eldigan with the masses .  Commander Anna could be seen standing at the top of the grand staircase that lead to the room of summoning .  Taking a second look the crowd wasn't nearly as cluttered as he thought , housing only 20 heroes in the wake of the Anna's towering presence . \
  "  Everyone be quiet ! The summoner needs silence to perform the summoning !  "   Commander Anna shouted , silencing the crowd .  Behind the door that was directly to her rear was Kiran , who was placing the 5 orbs they had obtained during their last skirmish with Bruno's forces into Breidablik .  He was humming the tune that the lady of the lake , Azura had taught him while out on patrol several nights ago . \
  "  And that makes five .  .  . these things are pain to get into this thing ,  "   Kiran griped as he readied the sacred weapon .  With his hand on the lever , he rose it up to his front , his target being the wall on the opposite side of the room just as it had always been since he had arrived .  With a strong yank of the lever , a concentrated orb shot from the barrel , bursting against the wall with a blinding white light .  Kiran immediately lowered his eyes , shielding them with his hood as the light brung fourth the new hero to join their ranks .  As the light came to a close , a beautiful girl stood before him ; she clearly favored the color violet , with every inch of her being shining with it .  She had very tired eyes and clung tightly onto a tome she had at her chest .  Kiran sighed then smiled as he bowed to her . \
  "  Welcome to Askr , my name is Kiran .  This may sound strange , but you have been summoned here today in order to help our cause in defeating a grand enemy that threatens time itself .  We graciously welcome you presence .  Please , tell me your name ,  "   Kiran put on his politest act , causing her to feel a bit more at ease .  The girl let out a relieving sigh , doing her best to put on her proper composure . \
  "  My name is Julia , I am the current empress of a land called Grannvale .  Along side my half brother , Seliph , we watched over it , protecting it as the worst happened .  Seliph has been gone for many months now , but I think being summoned to a place such as this will help me get my thoughts and actions in order .  It's a pleasure to meet you Kiran ,  "   Julia said with a nervous smile , her backstory matching up with a particular member of the army to the T so to speak . \
  "  Ah so you're THAT Julia ; Seliph has always spoken highly of you .  Your tome you are holding , that is Nago correct ? Don't worry , we'll help you keep it safe .  He mentioned the importance of it pretty clearly ,  "   Kiran replied , causing Julia's eyes to widen to the size of a full moon . \
  "  Seliph .  .  . is here ? Did you just say Seliph was here ?  "   Julia's eyes lit up as tears formed at their corners . \
  "  Yes , he has been a very valuable asset to our army and an irreplacable comrade in arms .  As I said before , he speaks very highly of you and I'm sure he will be overwhelmed with joy to see you again ,  "   Kiran said with a smile as he walked to the door .  Julia followed him with short , coy steps , getting a feeling for her new surroundings as she followed the friendly stranger in front of her .  Opening the door felt like opening the castle gate as an empress , meeting an audience of clapping individuals that made her feel special .  Instead of your standard villagers and citizens , she was met with a mixed bag of lords , knights and modest magicians who gave her the warmest of welcomes . \
  "  Hello everyone , I am Julia of Grannvale , it is a pleasure to meet all of you and I hope I can be helpful in your cause ,  "   Julia said with a smile , bowing to everyone respectfully .  The moment she walked out into the open , Seliph's eyes latched onto her ; his skin felt an odd sense of pale and his heart stopped only for a moment .  He wanted to charge up the steps but he knew it would be in very poor form .  Eldigan gave him a firm pat on his shoulder as his lord eyes glued to her . \
  "  My lord , perhaps it would be best if we left the crowd and awaited her to the side , she won't be as overwhelmed that way ,  "   he explained .  Seliph gave him a nod , disappearing out of the crowd and more towards the back wall away from them all .  Kiran helped escort her down the stairs until she was finally on the main ground , smiling at everyone .  As she turned away from the crowd , her eyes finally found what she wanted to see more than anything else in this world .  Seliph could be seen smiling right at her , waving at her to get her attention .  Julia's eyes immediately filled with tears as she made a dash for Seliph , throwing herself into his arms .  She began to sob loudly into his chest , a testament of the pain and anguish she felt over his disappearance . \
  "  I .  .  . I thought you were dead .  .  . I thought I'd never see you again .  .  .   "   Julia whimpered , drenching the chest of Seliph's uniform with her tears .  Seliph took a heavy sigh , tightly wrapping his arms around her with a tear or two leaving his as well .  He planted a gentle kiss on the top of her head as he rubbed her back , trying to help her relax a little so that he could actually get a good look at her face that he had missed for so long . \
  "  I never doubted for a second that I would find my way back to you Julia , but it seems you were the one that came to me .  I'm relieved beyond any words to have you back ,  "   Seliph said , giving Julia a bit of a room to back up .  Seliph removed his glove from his hand , gently wiping away her tears with his bare hand . \
  "  You can relax now Julia , I'm here .  I'm safe and sound and have fought my hardest everyday to stay that way .  I'm so glad your safe and sound Julia ,  "   Seliph whispered , now stroking her hair to calm her down to a regular point .  Julia grew rosey cheeks the longer she looked in Seliph's eyes , her feelings that she had for him had gone unscathed .  Seliph was unaware of the intimate feelings she had for him ; she dare not approach them however or their positions of emperor and emperess would be threatened with the world gazing on them with bitter intent .  But in this very moment , with his arms around her , she felt she could say anything that her heart beckoned her to .  But for now , she thought it best to get her wits about her .  Eldigan had a small smile on his face as she finally noticed his presence . \
  "  Who is this gentleman Seliph ?  "   she inquired , prompting Eldigan to kneel before her with his eyes still latched onto hers . \
  "  My name is Eldigan , I am a leader of the Agustrian forces that declared war against your land of Grannvale .  It is a pleasure to meet you , Julia .  You may question my loyalties considering I am of Agustrian descent , but after meeting Lord Seliph , who had risked his very life for me on the battlefield contrary to our sides of the war , I have decided to pledge my knightship to him for the remainder of our time in this land ,  "   Eldigan announced , raising back to his feet .  Julia was completely speechless , turning to Seliph who was still smiling back at her . \
  "  Here in Askr , all past feuds and rivalries are put to rest for the sake of the war that rages here .  There isn't a way to return home if we aren't all in cooperation with one another and see each other as friends and allies .  It may all seem overwhelming for now , but it will all become natural before you know it .  Eldigan , you are dismissed for now , me and Julia are going to catch up and I'm going to show her around the barracks ,  "   Seliph ordered . \
  "  Of course , I shall take my leave then ,  "   Eldigan said , turning to leave in the opposite direction .  Once everyone was out of sight , Julia clenched onto Seliph's arm , shuddering against him with a nervous look in her eyes . \
  "  Is .  .  . there something wrong Julia ? You look like you have a fever ,  "   Seliph raised his hand to her forehead , to which she grabbed and moved away .  Every time her eyes would meet his they would immediately shift away , taking their time to make their way back to his . \
  "  No .  .  . I'm not sick Seliph .  .  . I .  .  . um .  .  . I don't know how to explain it .  .  .   "   Julia's words fumbled a bit as Seliph took her hand in his , giving it a loving squeeze before moving forward . \
  "  Come with me then , I know a place or two that we can go brighten your spirits a bit ,  "   Seliph replied , leading her on a tour of the Askr barracks .  Julia couldn't but to gaze at the massive construction in wonder , the dizzying displays of heroic paintings and endless libraries of books making her lose her footing along the way .  Seliph graciously introduced her to many of the comrades that he had fought next to this whole time , as well as those that he had built strong bonds with .  It was all quite delightful stepping in a brand new world , especially one as wholesome as this .  The time they spent roaming the halls went by in the blink of an eye , the night sky casting its calms eyes on the barracks .  Seliph sighed with his heart racing as he approached his living quarters . \
  "  Since there isn't a particular room available , you'll be staying in my room for the time being .  I hope that's not too strange ,  "   Seliph said , trying to keep his cool as Julia gripped onto his arm firmly . \
  "  I don't mind it at all , I'm just gracious to have somewhere to rest .  If I'm next to you , Seliph , I know that nothing can go wrong ,  "   Julia said as he opened the door .  Just as expected , Seliph's room was in perfect shape with all of his belongings arranged in a neat and tidy manner .  He immediately began removing his attire piece by piece , hanging up his uniform on the hook after releasing his hair from its restraints .  Julia was always fond of Seliph's long , flowing blue hair that easily rearched his lower back ; he always kept it so tidy and neat , taking time out of his day to care for it each and every day .  She blushed and watched as he went so far as to remove his trousers as well ; it was if he had forgotten she was even in the room . \
  "  Sorry for the lack of room , I'll be happy to step out while you change .  I don't exactly have anything in your size , but feel free to use my robes , there are quite a few sashes around to keep it from falling off ,  "   Seliph said with a small laugh , leaving the room in nothing but a pair of sleeping slacks .  He rested his back against the cool , wooden door , lowering his head to think to himself on his current situation . \
  "  I have to keep it together .  .  . the last thing I want to do is scare Julia with my emotions and feelings .  I'll just pretend it will be like when we were much younger , that should do the trick ,  "   Seliph said , shaking his arms to loosen up his nerves .  It seemed like some time had passed since he had stepped out of the door , causing him to turn and give it a small knock . \
  "  Everything OK in there Julia ?  "   he asked , getting a small meek reply that signaled for him to come in .  Opening the door , he saw his robes desperately tied onto her small frame , with the chest of it clearly revealing the cleavage of her modestly sized chest .  He sighed softly and smiled , giving her a warm hug . \
  "  It'll do for now anyway .  I hope it suits you enough , I know its weird wearing your brother's clothes ,  "   Seliph said with a laugh , walking her over to the bed .  He threw back the sheets , allowing Julia to crawl into the bed first being followed by Seliph to her front . \
  "  Good night Julia , we'll be sure to set up a room for you tomorrow ,  "   Seliph said , giving Julia's head a small kiss before turning his back to her chest . \
  "  G-Good night Seliph ,  "   Julia stuttered as her body heated up from being next to Seliph .  This was the first time they had slept in the same bed since they were both very young , which wouldn't feel so strange had feelings not been developed for her beloved half brother .  She reached her arm beneath his , resting it on his chest as she tried to close her eyes and rest .  Julia couldn't help but to shiver next to Seliph as his scent made its way into her nose , a soft scent of soaps and blossoms making her grip on Seliph much tighter .  Seliph felt the same as he tried to keep facing forward , the familiar scent of the perfumes she would use intoxicating his system .  Julia moved her body down Seliph's a slight bit , giving her enough of a reach run her hands over his tight stomach , tracing the muscle lines gently as she burried her face into his middle back , taking in the scent of his hair this time . \
  "  Um .  .  . are .  .  . you OK Julia .  .  .  ?  "   Seliph asked nervously , picking up on her odd movements and caresses of his frame .  She immdiately stiffened up as if caught trying to leave the castle from when they were young , immediately shaking next to him once again . \
  "  I-It's nothing .  .  . I .  .  . um .  .  . Seliph .  .  ?  "   Julia clenched onto him tightly to ease her nerves , causing him to tense up as well . \
  "  Yes Julia ? What is it ?  "   He replied , placing his hands over hers affectionately .  She took another long whiff of his hair , causing her to break into another shiver fit . \
  "  I .  .  . have deeper feelings for you than just that of a sister .  .  . you may think it grotesque or immoral of me , but I feel that I will never have another chance to tell you this .  .  . when we were the heads of the monarchy , it would've been nothing short of scandlous .  I've had these feelings for some time , but I know that they shouldn't ever be said , especially in our other world .  But right now , being next to you , I feel that I have the courage to be honest about how I feel .  So , Seliph .  .  . I love you with all of my heart .  .  .   "   Julia said quietly , holding onto him tightly to brace for an answer she didn't wish to hear .  Instead , Seliph shuffled around , removing her hands from him so that he may turn to look at her face to face .  Julia couldn't help but to avert her blushing face , too ashamed and embrassed to look him dead in the eye while he faced her .  That's when he gently placed his hand on her warm cheek , trying to direct her attention back to him . \
  "  I love you too , Julia .  .  . I've had dreams of you ever since we were parted .  Dreams that seemed so shameful back then , but now , it is all too real .  I am not looking at you right now as your brother Julia .  I'm looking at you as a man in love with a wonderful , beautiful girl .  I .  .  . feel the same , I love you too , Julia ,  "   Seliph pressed his lips to hers , immediately latching his arms around her like a bear trap , pulling her into a passionate embrace .  Tears slid down her cheeks as Sepliph laid her onto her back , placing his hands next to her head so that he could look down upon her shy expression . \
  "  You really are the most beautiful person I have ever known Julia , and I'm honored that you would choose me of all people to be yours .  Now .  .  . allow me to show you my affection .  .  .   "   Seliph said , lowering his lips to hers once again , as their soft moans were exchanged , Seliph slid his hands down to the numerous sashes she had holding his large robe to her .  One by one he untied them , sliding the robe open so that his hands could truly explore her body .  He traced his fingers along her modest breasts , gently giving them small squeezes of affection as his tongue seized her within their mouths .  Julia could do nothing more but to moan and groan , her hands clasping onto his shoulders as his hands grew more bold .  He parted his lips from hers as his fingers traced along the brim of her nether lips , gently rubbing along it before pressing one finger against its insides .  Julia's grip on Seliph's shoulders tightened as she began to whine , the stimulation from Seliph's touch beginning to drive her crazy . \
  "  I need more of you Julia , please , accept my love ,  "   Seliph said , moving his lips to her neck , dragging them down onto her chest .  His kisses and licks came alive as he enjoyed the taste of her delicate , pale skin , his own passions begining to arise as well .  Julia's eyes grew hazy from her body heat as she watched Seliph's mouth and body move from her chest , down her slender stomach and eventually ending at the top of her crotch . \
  "  I .  .  . like your scent ,  "   Seliph whispered up to her with a blushing smile .  He then parted his lips , sliding his tongue overtop of his body lip before pressing it into her warm , moist crevice .  Julia let out a loud squeak , her hands now moving through Seliph's hair as he tasted her sweet nectar for himself .  He grew dizzy from her scent that grew stronger by the moment , now spreading her nether lips with his thumbs to allow his tongue to dig deeper inside of her .  Julia found herself clenching her legs around his neck , gripping his silky blue locks as his mouth and tongue ran wild . \
  "  S-S-SELIPH !  "   Julia cried as she covered her mouth , whining and crying out as her legs began strangling him and her hands taking vast handfulls of his hair as she came to a climax .  Seliph began to hum softly , breathing through his nose calmly to keep his breath in circulation .  Julia's sensation slowly subsided , her legs now letting Seliph loose so that he could raise back up onto his hands and knees . \
  "  Your taste and scent are truly intoxicating Julia .  .  . in a good way of course ,  "   Seliph whispered as he rustled his bottoms off at the end of the bed .  Julia noticed his rather sizely appendage in the dim light , which caused a sensational blush to grace her face .  Seliph smiled warmly as he crawled back over top of her , gently parting her legs with his hands as the tip of his crotch rubbed inside of her slit . \
  "  Julia .  .  . you've made me one of the happiest men alive this evening , now please , allow me to make you just as joyed ,  "   Seliph whispered against her lips , slowly sliding the head of his member deeper , its width now surrounded in warmth and moisture . \
  "  I am all yours Seliph , you've already made me the happiest girl I could ever be .  I want you to claim me as your own , as I shall do the same for you ,  "   Julia whispered back , running her cool , slender hand along his cheek .  They both shared an intense gasp as Seliph slowly sheathed his member all the way inside of her , hitting her deepest parts with his size .  They both trembled and smiled , staying still as their genitalia grew familiar with one another .  Julia slowly ran her hands up Seliph's arms , gently tracing his muscle as they eventually rolled behind his neck . \
Julia took the lead in capturing Seliph's lips , claiming them as her own as Seliph made his first stroke into her .  Julia wrapped her legs around his waist as his hips began to sway back and fourth .  Every time his length would dig in deep , her insides would clench around it , causing him to moan out helplessly from its sensation .  Julia's cries matched his own as his thrusts grew stronger , the bed beginning to shift with their frames . \
  "  G-Go harder Seliph , I can't get enough of this .  .  . I want more of you !  "   Julia cried , her nails digging into his back as his manhood thrashed into her soaked nether region , rubbing it raw from its harsh clenching around his prick .  Seliph groaned in pain and pleasure , tightly clenching the sheets at her sides harsher by the thrust .  They had now broken down the wall of restraint , now hopelessly moaning and crying out loudly to one another .  No more thoughts of hesitation or shame was left between them , only passion , love and lust existing in their own little world .  Seliph's cries grew in volume as his body began to shake and shudder violently . \
  "  I LOVE YOU JULIA !  "   Seliph cried out against her lips , seizing them aggressively as his body tensed up as hard as steel .  Julia gasped loudly as she felt a strange sensation within her insides ; a warm , thick fluid began releasing inside of her .  Little by little Seliph's seed poured inside her , filling her to the brim .  His shuddering was accompanied by loud huffs for breath an a flood of sweat that they both shared with one another in the heat of their passion . \
  "  Its so warm .  .  .   "   Julia sighed contently , removing her nails from Seliph's now bleeding back .  Seliph was clearly numb to the pain to as he kissed her gently once more . \
  "  Can .  .  . we do that again , Seliph ?  "   Julia asked as Seliph slowly removed his throbbing manhood from her womanhood .  A large grin spread across Seliph's lips as he gazed into her eyes . \
  "  Anything for you , my love ,  "   Seliph said , pressing his forhead to hers .  Julia continued to smile as he got up from her .  She then slowly made her way onto her hands and knees , looking back at him with a soft giggle . \
  "  How about like this ?  "   Julia said , her sleepy eyes filled with a strange tone of perversity .  Seliph couldn't help but to flash a toothy grin and shake his head at her obnoxiously cute attitude towards the situation .  He immediately moved up behind her with the curve of his freshly arroused manhood resting against her rear ; he ran his hands up and down her sides before positioning her semen filled snatch against his tip . \
  "  Ready ?  "   Seliph whispered , being quickly replied with a nod of her head .  Julia's face filled with surprise as she felt Seliph's member tear through her insides deeper than before .  She lout out a small scream , her head dropping down towards the bed as she began to tremble in her grasp . \
  "  Are you alright Julia ? Did I hurt you ?  "   Seliph's cocern warmed Julia's heart as it continued to pound ruthlessly inside of her chest . \
  "  N-No , I'm fine .  .  . that was a good scream .  .  .   "   Julia said , hiding her blushing face from Seliph .  Seliph simply smiled , leaning forward to kiss between her shoulder blades before grasping onto her sides roughly .  Julia found herself in a state of perpetual lust as Seliph started to push deeply inside of her , sloshing around her fluids and his seed vigorously .  The rougher Seliph went , the tighter she clenched around his length , causing him to whine and cry out with every shift .  Seliph couldn't believe the sounds that were leaving Julia's lips as he ravaged her from behind ; he always knew her to be so soft spoken with an impecable dialect , but now she was crying and moaning out wildly from his touch , which caused his heart to pound and rush about in his chest . \
It wasn't long before Julia was burying her face into her pillow , screaming wildly as she trembled and tensed up from a plethra of climaxes in succession .  Seliph could no longer hold out as he began to shudder as well , reaching and grabbing a hold of her breasts firmly as he pourned another load of his semen inside of her snatch .  They both stayed in place , breathing for their lives as they continued to stay connected , their lover's dance coming to a close .  Julia pulled her head out of the pillow and looked between her legs as Seliph removed his exausted member .  A coy smile spread along her lips as she saw a he seed oozing out of her , its flow from her crevice giving her a pleseant , warm feeling of sorts . \
  "  He really does love me .  .  .   "   Julia laughed softly as she rolled onto her back , holding her arms out for her beloved Seliph to come into .  Seliph smiled wide , slowly lowering his body onto hers and into her grasp . \
  "  I am now yours forever Julia , for better or worse ,  "   Seliph said , brushing her bangs from her sweating forehead to plant a dry against against it . \
  "  And I am yours as well Seliph , no matter what others may say , no matter what they may think , this is a decision I will never regret for as long as I live ,  "   Julia said as Seliph returned her grasp that she had onto him .  It was the best nights rest that either of them had ever shared , another fine testament to the truth of their love .  They weren't sure if they were going to announce it anytime soon , but there was one thing for sure : she wouldn't need her own room anymore . \
  "  Hey uh .  .  . Summoner ! Can I talk to ya' a sec ? !  "   Nephenee called out quite audibly into the mess hall .  At this time of day it was rather busy so if anyone wanted to get a person's attention , it was either raise your voice or don't bother trying .  Kiran smiled , raising up from his table with a good , long stretch .  Without haste he dashed through the mess hall and right up to her in a matter of minutes . \
  "  You know you can call me Kiran , Nephenee .  What's going on ?  "   Kiran asked .  As of late the two of them had learned more and more about one another each day .  Wether its on the battlefield or even within the barracks , the two of them shared so much in common when it came to their upbringings .  Because of this , Nephenee could feel comfortable in her rather unrefined speech patterns and vocabulary with him , especially since he could actually tolerate it without trying to correct her all the time . \
  "  Erm .  .  . I have somethin' I wanna tell ya' .  Can we head to the , you know , the place outside of the barracks with the small open sitting area ? The um arbalestum .  .  .   "   Nephenee stuttered lightly , her nerves getting the best of her .  Kiran couldn't help but expell a small laugh before giving her his full attention and a smirk . \
  "  Do you mean the arboretum ?  "   Kiran asked .  Nephenee blushed lightly sighing at her poor attempts at trying to figure out the word , but was glad that Kiran knew exactly what she meant . \
  "  Yeah , the arboretum , do you think we could talk there ?  "   Nephenee smiled as Kiran replied with a suttle nod .  The two of them could help but smile wide at one another considering their feelings were in full bloom without them even knowing it .  They both recieved strange looks as each warrior that passed by paid respect to Kiran for his exploits .  This made Nephenee feel a bit off , but Kiran occasionaly gave her side a nudge , reminding her that it wasn't a big deal .  As they stepped out into the open air , they both marveled at the sight of a setting sun , the cool , warm air of the evening beginning to role in with its slumber behind the mountains .  Kiran shielded his eyes to better taken in the beautiful sky while Nephenee let loose a loud yawn as she stretched her limbs to the sky . \
  "  Gods , this is such a beautiful sunset ! I don't think I've truly seen a fine sunset since I have arrived ,  "   Kiran said as Nephenee grasped a hold of his hand .  He gaze at her with mild confusion as she flashed him a bright and happy grin . \
  "  We can't find it just standin' around , come on !  "   Nephenee smiled as she then took off like the wind , nearly dragging Kiran off of his feet .  They both smiled and laughed as they let the wind blanket them as they ran , the brilliant smells of the wildlife dancing through it and upon them both .  Kiran was surprised at how innocent Nephenee's expressions were when basking in the outdoors , as if it were her home sweet home .  He had never seen her smile so wide , considering how shy she always comes off to the others .  All he knew was she was a ferocious battler that came from a humble country family who gave her all to everything each day .  It was a quick trip to the arboretum due to the pace in which they ran , appearing from over the horizon as they approached .  Kiran was the first to step in , quickly taking a seat on the opposite side .  Nephenee then plopped next to him eyeing him as they settled down . \
  "  So what's it like where you're from ? I think I asked ya' once before but you weren't exactly available .  You got dragged off by Commander Anna to discuss tactics and what not for the next battle ,  "   Nephenee inquired .  No one really knew too much about Kiran ; all they knew as they he came in one day from the weapon and since then he has proven to be an excellent tactician .  Kiran sighed softly as he leaned back in his seat , now staring at the top of the arboretum as if lost in thought . \
  "  My world is a very crazy place ; where you would take mount upon steeds here to cross the land , we instead drove automobiles , or machines that we control to take us places , to go to them with great speed easily faster than that of two dozen horses .  Where we battle with swords and axes and such here , in my world our armies fight with guns , which look very similar to the Breidablik ; they shoot projectiles that are as fast as lightning to kill their foes .  The people in my world are always in a hurry and rarely take the time to consider others at times , but not everyone is evil by any means . \
To be honest , it was hard adapting to this world at first , but now that I've embraced it for what it is , I've become quite fond of it , just as I have become quite fond of you , Nephenee .  You're like me , neither of us are even close to anything that would be considered royalty or nobel .  Honestly when many of our warriors are discussing things in the main command center , I can only understand half of what they are saying .  It's been very comforting to meet someone whose origins are just as common as my own , someone who can really understand what its like to be a normal human being you know ?  "   Kiran's face was a light shade of crimson as his passionate words flew through the air like scattered showers , raining down upon Nephenee to enlighten her . \
  "  Shucks .  .  . I mean , um .  .  . thank you Kiran , I'm glad that you can find comfort in my presence as I do in yours .  I find that battles suit me more than conversations , but in your case I think its the opposite ; when I'm with you Kiran talking is much easier , as if I can breathe while around someone , which is quite a nice feelin' ,  "   Nephenee replied .  As sun made its way into the setting mountains , Nephenee found herself free and relaxed ; which is a first for her when being around anyone , much les a member of the opposite sex .  Kiran gently grasped onto Nephenee's arm , slowly moving his head to her shoulder so that it could rest comfortably . \
  "  Is everythin' OK Kiran ? You're kinda makin' me blush a bit ,  "   Nephenee said with a nervous smile as Kiran nuzzled the side of his head into her shoulder , adjusting it to be more comfortable .  Nephenee rested her hands in her lap , sitting as still as a statue as Kiran tilted his eyes to hers . \
  "  You make everything wonderful Nephenee .  .  . your big heart , your kindness , your ferocity in battle , all of these things make my heart flutter when I'm with you ,  "   Kiran blushed as well , gently caressing her cheek with the back of his hand .  She finally began to loosen up as her heart began to dance in her chest , his words making her grow warmer by the second . \
  "  I'm not too sure how to reply to that but thank you .  I honestly don't think any of that is a very big deal , its all just things I learned from my folks and growing up in general .  I don't know why so many people make things more difficult than they need to be y'know ?  "   Nephenee sighed as Kiran tilted his head up to look into her eyes . \
  "  Tell me a little about where you came from Nephenee , I hardly know anything about your homeland or even simple things about you , like your likes and dislikes .  I can share mine too if you'd like ,  "   Kiran said , resting his eyes once more as he placed his head back on her shoulder . \
  "  I'd like that very much actually .  As for me , my home wasn't anything too special .  It was mostly plains and farmlands for miles in every direction .  Before I joined the mercenary group I was just a typical bright eyed , carefree farm girl that wanted to see the world beyond the plains .  Who would've thought I would find comfort in something such as battling .  It's kind of silly to think about , but the battlefield is one of the few places I can feel free .  I'm quite fond of wheat and fish but I can't stand poltry .  Ale honestly makes me ill so I prefer to have some good ol' milk with my meals .  A little known secret about me is that I enjoy collecting things from nature .  As long as its beautiful and/or unique , I'll hold on to it .  I guess its sort of like keeping a piece of home with me if that makes any sense ,  "   Nephenee let out a gentle sigh of relief , letting her words fly free .  The feeling as if her heart was resting upon a cloud overtook her as she rested her head on Kiran's . \
  "  That's very profound , it makes perfect sense that you'd want to keep a piece of home with you .  To be honest if there was anything like that here from my world I'd feel the same .  I don't pine for it as much as I used to though , now it feels as if it was a long , passing daydream that I remember perfectly .  I honestly miss my mother and father as well as my friends , but here in this world , its like none of it mattered , which is strange to me .  As for things about me I do enjoy partaking in food as well .  One of my favorites is a dish called Pizza .  Its bread topped with mashed up tomatos and cheese .  You then cook is for about 10 minutes , or enough to let it all blend together .  Trust me , I know it sounds strange , but its amazing .  I'm just like you when it comes to drink , Ale make me sick as well .  And as for a hobby , I like to write stories .  Mostly things that relate to my home world , kind of like your collecting actually .  I'm not sure if you're fond of literature , but if you ever want to read it , I'd gladly share it with you ,  "   Kiran said , reaching to lace his fingers in between Nephenee's to grasp her hand .  She gave his hand a loving squeeze in response , nuzzling her head against Kiran's in response . \
  "  I knew there was a wonderful girl underneath that quiet facade and armor .  To be honest , I'm not sure what I'd do if you had to return to your world .  Nephenee , I'm not sure how you feel about all this but .  .  . I'm in love with you .  I have been ever since you were able to save me on the battlefield way back when .  I know you were just doing your job and following your heart , but it meant something to me .  Nephenee , I want you to stay with me for the rest our lives ,  "   Kiran said , hsi face red as a strawberry as his faced closed in on hers .  Her face was lit up as well , her heart now pounding in her throat as she tried to react to his words .  As his face grew closer and closer she began to find herself submitting to its advance . \
  "  I-I uh .  .  . um .  .  . K-Kiran , I .  .  .   "   Nephenee's words fumbled with her wildly shaking , nervous heart , to which Kiran silenced with his lips to hers .  All of Nephenee's nerves , thoughts of rejection , and feelings of unworth all melted away in an instant like mud being washed away .  Kiran's hands crawled up her arms and onto her shoulders , giving them an affectionate squeeze as they began to exchange loving kisses .  They retreated their lips from one another , blushing heavily like a couple of high school sweet hearts as they gazed at one another . \
  "  I .  .  . love you too Kiran .  .  . I honestly do at this point .  .  . I can't imagine a world without you and your kind , caring self nor do I ever want to be in one like it ,  "   Nephenee finally got her words out , her hands grasping onto his arms , moving them around her waist as she blushed in his eyes . \
  "  Not only are you so sweet , but having you be so attractive has made this difficult .  .  . I .  .  . I'm not sure how much longer I can keep my hands off you to be honest .  You're just make my heart thrash in my chest , it has been quite difficult to hide my feelings over the course of knowing you in fear of you not feeling the same ,  "   Kiran's eyes shifted from hers , then back onto hers , then off again , causing a soft snicker to leave her lips at his anxious honesty .  Something clicked inside of Nephenee as she thought of being physical with Kiran .  It was a strange feeling of both wanting and taking , as if all of her physical thoughts manifested into an aggressive , passionate urge that she didn't want to contain . \
  "  To be honest , I've always wanted your hands on me Kiran .  It's not like you're unattractive yourself y'know , you make my body itch when I think of you at night .  So , now that you know how I feel , you can put your hands on me all ya' want .  In fact .  .  . how about we do a little bit of explorin' of each other back in my room , what do ya' say to that ?  "   Nephenee's eyes narrowed onto his seductively , showing that she had nothing to hide when it came to her feelings . \
  "  I would love nothing more , by all means , lead the way ,  "   Kiran's eyes lit up with joy as he grasped onto her hand , letting her lead him onward to wherever she wanted him .  He was somewhat surprised at how bold she was , wanting to be so intimate with him after such a short time .  But then again , the rules of love were much different here than back home , which is definitely one thing Kiran liked much better in this world .  Upon arrival at her door , she gave Kiran a loving kiss on his lips before swinging the door open , yanking him inside before shutting the door . \
Nephenee continued to eye him affectionately , quickly undoing her armor and pitching her helmet , letting it all crash to the ground .  Before Kiran had a moment to react , Nephenee pulled on his arm , dragging him roughly onto her bed with a thump .  She smirked as she used her brutish strength to pen Kiran to her bed , suddenly attacking his lips with her own as she moved upon his waist . \
  "  I hope ya' don't mind gettin' a little rough , because I can't hold myself back any longer ,  "   Nephenee giggled , causing Kiran to grin back at her with a toothy smile .  He hadn't had any form of intimate physical contact ever since he had come to this world , so this was definitely welcomed with all of his heart . \
  "  And here I thought you were the shy type .  .  . I can be as rough as you want , and you can be as rough with me as your heart desires ,  "   Kiran winked , moving his hands to the brim of her shirt to help her remove it from her frame .  Nephenee began kissing anxiously upon Kiran's chest , kissing and licking her way around as she lowered down Kiran's bottoms from beneath his robe .  Kiran moaned and gasped from such affection , resting his hand upon her head as she made her way down .  He helped kick off his bottoms completely with a smile , a loving giggle meeting against his erect member from her lips . \
  "  You're certainly .  .  . a healthy man ,  "   Nephenee grinned , kissing all along its curve .  Kiran's eyes hazed over , completely at a lost for words as lust poured all over his body , his actions growing more and more helpless by the moment .  Dragging and wrapping her tongue around Kiran's member causing moans and groans to ease out from his mouth . \
  "  T-Thanks .  You're good at this .  .  .   "   Kiran whimpered , grasping onto her head gently to move her lips the head of his twitching member .  Nephenee giggled , kissing the tip a few times while keeping her eyes locked on his . \
  "  You're also very direct ,  "   Nephenee snickered as she pinched her lips around his head .  Slowly , her lips tightened around his moist member , slowly moving down to take more and more of it into her mouth before moving off . \
  "  Is that what ya' want Kiran ?  "   Nephenee smiled , a helpless nod of his head giving her the green light to go .  She gently placed her fingers and thumb on the base of his member , holding it upright so that she could seize it with her mouth aggressively .  Kiran began to howl out as Nephenee cupped his length with her tongue , bobbing her head upon his growth as if her life depened on it .  Kirin removed his hands from her head , gripping the sheets to his sides tightly as Nephenee continued to eat him alive . \
  "  S-Slow down ! I'm about to .  .  .  !  "   Kiran cried through clenched teeth , his frame now shaking vigorously as she continued .  Since he had gone nearly a year now without any form of intercourse , his body was certainly sensitive to say the least .  He threw his head back into his pillow , tearing the sheets free of the bed as he let out a lustful cry .  Nephenee moved her long green hair behind her ear , gently stroking the base of his member as she clenched her lips around the head of his member .  She smiled up at him as his member pulsated and twitched , releasing a load of his thick , warm seed into her mouth .  She slowed down her movements , taking more of it into her mouth then sucking it roughly to get every drop of his nectar out and into her mouth .  She continued swirling her tongue around his head as she swallowed his load little by little , causing him to shake and whine helplessly .  Nephenee then removed her lips with an audible , slurpy pop , now giggling softly . \
  "  You were certainly hasty .  .  . don't worry , it's OK .  It just means I'm good right ?  "   Nephenee blushed , smiling as she continued to run her finger along his curve , watching it twitch with each small stride .  Kiran smiled back at her , still shaking a bit as he held his arms open , signaling for her to move on up .  Nephenee slowly crawled over top of him , straddling him as she smooshed her shapely breasts against his pale chest . \
  "  Yeah .  .  . you are definitely good .  But don't worry , I can go aga .  .  .   "   Kiran's words were cut off with Nephenee's lips lovingly taking his .  She cupped his cheeks with her hands , passionately gracing his mouth with her tongue as she ground her cloth covered crotch against Kiran's bare and twitching one .  They shared pants and moans the more their kisses grew sloppy , giving Kiran the courage to take bolder actions .  His hands began running down her back , tracing it with his fingers until they met her shapely , well toned rear , which he gave an affectionate squeeze .  Nephenee gasped against his lips , moving her hands down to tear her underwear off forcibly with her might .  The soft , squishy sounds of her warm moist crotch smothering his caused them both to blush , both of them gasping as their tongues parted from one another . \
  "  I can't believe this is happening .  .  . I never thought I'd be able to share a moment like this with someone as beautiful and strong as you .  You are my dream come true Nephenee , please , stay with me like this forever ,  "   Kiran's words escaped his lips hastily , his face turning bright red as she grinned back at him . \
  "  You're so darn cute Kiran , I would love nothin' more than to stay like this with you .  You're really sweet and kind , and y'know how to treat a girl right .  Now , let's have some fun , what do you say ?  "   Nephenee planted a playful kiss on Kiran's lips with a wide grin , causing him to playfully squeeze her rear as a retourt .  Nephenee let out a small yelp , feeling Kiran's member growing completely erect beneath her .  Nephenee then raised up her rear , grasping the base of Kiran's manhood to line it up with her anxious , hungry crotch . \
  "  Ready Kiran ?  "   She asked , causing Kiran to pull her lips down to his for a few moments .  He traced her lips with his tongue before releasing her , laughing softly as she gazed down at him . \
  "  I'm all yours ,  "   Kiran replied , gasping as he felt his length being enclosed in her warm , moist crevice .  It was like a furnace against it , pulses of her cunt clenching and releasing it lovingly .  Nephenee sat up , moaning as she straighted up her back while on top of Kiran , gently pressing her fingers into his chest .  Nephenee's eyes fluttered closed as she leaned forward , pressing on Kiran's as she rose up then dropped her weight back down on his member , shooting it up inside her deeply . \
  "  AH ! Mmf .  .  . you're size is stretching me out a bit .  .  .   "   Nephenee groaned , moving her her hips to move off again then dropping her full weight down again .  This time causing Kiran to whimper loudly and grasp onto her rear . \
  "  Y-You're really tight on it , are you sure it doesn't hurt ?  "   Kiran grunted , Nephenee shook her head as her nails lightly grazed again his chest as she started to ride him consistantly , twitching and shaking from the mild pain of her insides being forced apart .  Nephenee began moaning into Kiran's face , crying out with each forcefully slam onto Kiran's member .  Kiran's body felt like it was on fire , beginning to sweat as he put his strength into his arms and hands to help her move on him easier .  Her breasts and hair began to sway as she decided to go a bit faster , forcing Kiran's hands off of her rear and up to her chest , to which he squeezed roughly with his shaking hands .  The loud , sloshy and slapping noises of their bodies colliding grew louder as she made longer strides with each slide on his length .  Her hips slammed down on his sizeable member hard enough that he felt the deepest part of her lustful innards , her moans and cries growing louder .  She began to dig her nails into Kiran's flesh as she fondled her breasts lovingly , shaking and groaning from the hints of pain that shot through him . \
  "  I-It feels amazing , doesn't it ? ! It feels incredible to me !  "   Nephenee panted loudly , her nails beginning to draw light points of blood from his chest as she rode him wildly .  Kiran quickly returned his hands to her rear , gripping it with all of his strength and moving her on him as hard as she could .  Her cries grew uncontrollable , her legs now trembling as if she were in a snow storm .  Losing her balance , she grasped onto the back of Kiran's head with her hands , smothering his her lips against his harshly .  Their cries danced together as their bodies continued , ready to lose themselves at any moment .  Nephenee suddenly screamed into Kiran's lips , slamming her hips down as hard as she could as she grew stiff , trembling in Kiran's grasp .  Kiran held her rear still , thrusting up inside of her harder and harder himself until he couldn't take anymore either .  His wild yells of passion clashed against her screams as he quickly latched his arms around her back , forcing her body against his own tightly as he expelled more of his thick , passsionate nectar , this time inside of her wonderfully moist nether region .  They continued to exchange sloppy kisses as they whined and groaned , their bodies tensions slowly subsiding by the minute .  Their gasps turned into heavy breaths as they held on to one another , now pressing their sweat covered forheads together . \
  "  I love you Nephenee .  I love you to the point of tears now , unsure as to how I would live without you now .  .  .   "   Kiran sighed contently as he watched his seed ooze out from her snatch , the corners of his eyes tearing up with joy as she returned a smile to him . \
  "  And I love you too you sappy fool .  I won't ever let any harm befall you for the rest of our lives , and I promise to give you my all everyday , well , as much as you can handle anyway ,  "   Nephenee let out a short giggle as she planted another kiss on his lips .  It was strange how natural it all was to them , neither felt shame nor regret .  All that was between them was a raw form of love which could only be found within loving , simple hearts . \
Today was a day of rest and relaxation with the training regime beginning at the crack of dawn the next morning .  Robin took this opportunity to partake in one of his favorite hobbies : people watching .  He spent his time during the relaxation period by the Summoner , talking about his world and about all of the members within their group .  It was quite enlightening really , Zen like in its own regard .  Most of their group took to the waters to enjoy the cleansing feeling of the ocean while others decided to simply enjoy the sun .  All in all it was a very fun event to partake in and watch .  Any time of peace between battles in a war was more welcome than anything else in existence . \
Remembering what Corryn thought about in her room , she immediately set out on a mission to find Robyn and drag her into the sea with her .  Sure enough , near Robin , Kiran , and a few other tome specialists , Robyn was sitting quietly in her own little section of the sand , reading from her tome as the sounds of fun and enjoyment echoed through the air around her .  Robyn's attention was so invested in her tome that she didn't hear the shuffling , sandy footsteps approaching her from her front .  Suddenly , her tome vanished from her hands , causing her to finally notice the shadow looming over her .  Her face turned red from the incredibly revealing , and very cute bikini that Corryn was sporting while smiling down at her . \
  "  No more book time , you need to come out and get some sun with me !  "   Corryn grinned , tossing Robyn's tome at Kiran who caught it with a smile .  Robyn pouted as she went to go get her book , only to have Corryn snatch her up off the ground .  Having dragon's blood running through her veins made Corryn quite strong when she wanted to be . \
  "  P-Put me down ! I can walk , I can walk !  "   Robyn whined as her body grew warmer from both the heat and Corryn's hands on her .  Corryn smiled into her eyes like a goof giving her an   "  oh really ?  "   face . \
  "  Can I trust you that you want run back for your book ?  "   Corryn asked , getting a hasty nod from Robyn .  Corryn gently set her onto her feet so that she wouldn't fall then took her hand . \
  "  I found a spot where it can just be me and you for awhile , would you prefer that ?  "   Corryn asked , beginning to drag Robyn with her before she could even reply .  Corryn was completely determined to help Robyn break out of her shell and to become much more sociable .  Robyn sported a strawberry face as she gave her a meek nod , following behind her as they tredged through the sand . \
  "  She has so much confidence in her body , I'm incredibly jealous .  Looking around at everyone , its like all of their eyes are glued onto her , and just kind of ignoring me .  .  . it's honestly not that big of a deal , as long as Corryn likes it anyway ,  "   Robin filled her mind full of nervous thoughts and insecurities as all of the heroes around them commenced in their fun and activities .  She quickly noticed Chrom and Frederick taking pleasure in the salty waters of the ocean while Nowi , Lissa , and the Nohrian princess Elise were all making some sort of sculpture out of the sand . \
Corryn and Robbyn then noticed that Kiran had left his little perch next to her gender reversed counterpart and was setting up a strange net that he stretched until it was tight .  He strung it between to pikes that were jammed deeply into the sand to the point where they were sturdy .  He was also instructing several of the other heroes to make a set of lines in the sand , as if setting up some sort of arena . \
  "  Want to check out what they're doing Robyn ?  "   Corryn said , nudging her side playfully to get her attention .  Robyn looked up at her then looked at everyone working hard to set up the strange sight . \
  "  Sure why not , I'm kind of interested in seeing what they're doing as well ,  "   Robyn said with a smile , the both of them now getting close to the sight .  Kiran then removed what looked like some kind of ball that had been stitched together , throwing it up and catching it to make sure that it would suit his needs . \
  "  I'm going to show you a game that comes from my home country .  It's called volley ball .  The objective is to hit the ball over the net using your hands .  The way you score is if the volley ball hits the ground on the opposite side of the net .  Robyn , come over here and help me demonstrate ,  "   Kiran called over , waving his hand at Robyn .  Robyn's face lit up red , looking around nervously at everyone whose attentions were now strictly focused on her .  Corryn snickered and gave Robyn a firm push , causing her to tople into Kirin , who caught her .  She looked back at Corryn , who was now smiling and cheering her on . \
  "  I have to do my best for Corryn .  Alright , tell me what to do !  "   Robyn spoke up , getting the surrounding heroes excited for the strange event .  Kiran smirked , leaning in next to her ear befor giving her a supportive pat on the back . \
  "  I'm proud of you , you should really be more confident in yourself Robyn .  Alright , get on the other side of the net .  I'm going to hit the ball over the net and I want you to hit it back .  Here let me show you the best way to do that .  .  .   "   Kiran said with a delightful smile as he moved up behind Corryn , positioning her hands and arms the way they needed to be .  Robyn kept focusing her eyes on Corryn , trying her best to impress her after she pushed her into the spotlight .  Robyn hopped over to the other side of the net , getting into the position that Kiran had instructed for her to do . \
  "  Alright ! Here it comes Robyn !  "   Kiran shouted , tossing the ball up and smacking it with his hand .  Robyn watched carefully as the ball soared over the net , its landing trajectory a hop away from where she was standing .  Her eyes finally caught sight of where it was going to land , her feet refusing to move from her standing place from her nerves .  Refusing to look like a fool , she tensed up her legs , leaping to the ground to hit the ball back over due to her lack of reaction time .  Her overcoat flew off with the wind as she his the sand with a sound thump , her fists managing to hit the ball back over the net .  Robyn couldn't help but feel excitement shoot through her system , helping her gain the energy to get out of the sand .  The other heroes continued to cheer her on as Kiran hit it back over the net . \
  "  Come on Robyn you can do it !  "   Corryn shouted as loudly as she could , immediately pushing Robyn back onto her feet with her verbal encouragement .  Her eyes caught a hold of the ball , leaping once more and hitting it back over again .  Robyn found herself completely covered from head to toe with sand , but she paid no heed as the volley ball game persisted .  When she got to her feet once more , she noticed a scary sight .  Kiran charged for the balls location with great velocity .  He then leapt up into the air , slamming the ball down with his palm as hard as he could .  Robyn lost her balance , staring at the ball as it came soaring at her with great speed .  As if in a blur , she suddenly found herself in the shadow of her crush , using her hands to knock the cannon shot of a ball hit back over the net with a loud pound of her hands to protect her from getting hurt . \
  "  Come on ! Get up ! We can take him together !  "   Corryn giggled , helping Robyn onto her feet .  Robyn's face lit up red as everyone began cheering them on , one person after another taking a place on each side of the net .  At first each person carefully hit it over , not focusing on scoring at all but getting used to how the ball moved .  But gradually , the more it was volleyed , each team began to get more aggressive with their hits and tactics .  Before they knew it , every single hero in the troop was on one side of the net or the other , getting into the game with great wonder .  After a volley from Lissa , Kiran ran and snagged the ball out of the air , landing on his feet off to the side . \
  "  Alright ! That's some excellent team building I'm seeing ! Alright , everyone get over here , we're going to set up actual teams and we're going to play for real !  "   Kiran rallied everyone over to the side all of them laughing and chatting amongst themselves over how much fun they were having . \
  "  Seeing that we have an even number of members from two seperate worlds , we're going to have a game based on the countries in which the players represent .  Let's see let's see .  .  . OK got it ! The teams are going to be Team Ylisse against Team Nohr .  Everyone get together in your two groups and begin ! Oh Robin , I want you to assist me with scoring and watching , is that alright with you ?  "   Kiran ordered .  Robin gave him a thumbs up , running up next to him .  Without delay the two parties convened , with Robyn's heart sinking at the thought that she couldn't be on the same team as Corryn .  Regardless , she needed to prove that she was going to be strong .  Corryn managed to sneak up behind Robyn , hugging her around her neck as she laughed . \
  "  Let's make a wager , if you manage to score against our team we can do whatever you want afterwards , but if I score first , I'm going to force you to stay with the group .  Sound fair ?  "   Corryn smirked , causing Robyn to laugh nervously . \
  "  That sounds like a deal , good luck ,  "   Robyn said as Corryn moved off of her .  Robyn sighed and shook her head to get herself together as she noticed Chrom calling everyone in .  Corryn then stretched out , grinning as she ran to be with her loving Nohr family . \
  "  So it seems that the taller , stronger people should be near the front of the net , while the more nimble ones need to be on the back line .  OK , I have placements for everyone .  Leo , Myself , Niles , and Effie will handle the front line .  Corryn , Elise , Peri , and Camilla , you will all take the rear .  Let's show them what the country of Nohr does to its enemies !  "   Xander ordered them about .  Peri and Elise smirked at one another while Camilla and Corryn gave each other a big hug of encouragement before getting into position .  Meanwhile , the Ylisse side was taking quite a while to get their plans in order . \
  "  So uh .  .  . hmm .  .  . OK I think I see what to do now .  We need to choose people according to height on where they should be .  Frederick , myself , Sully , and Gaius will take the front while Nowi , Lissa , Robyn and Lucina will take the rear .  Let's show those pompous Nohrian's how the Ylisse get things done !  "   Chrom set up , dispersing everyone .  Sully popped her joints as she took the front next to Chrom and Gaius while Frederick refused to leave Chrom's side .  Lissa , Nowi , Lucina and Robyn put there hands upon one another , giving out a cheer as they dispersed .  Robyn and Corryn refused to break eye contact , both of them shooting confident smiles at one another .  Meanwhile , the front lines were sizing each other up ; Chrom looked on at Xander , who was sporting an overbearing amount confidence .  Frederick was looking down on Leo while he gulped at Frederick's impressive physique .  Gaius noticed Niles's eyes checking him out in the most uncomfortable manner possible while Effie and Sully glared at each other , ready to show the other whose truly the toughest woman on the field . \
  "  Alright Robyn , since you were the first to try the game out , we're going to make you our server .  Give it your best shot !  "   Chrom smirked giving her a thumb up .  Kiran tossed Robyn the ball , which looked down at it cautiously before returning her eyes to Corryn's . \
  "  This is my chance ; I have to score before she does !  "   Robyn psyched herself up as Kiran and Robin stood on each side of the net .  Kiran nodded over at Robin , giving him the signal to get the match started . \
  "  Begin !  "   Robin shouted .  Everyone immediately got into position , getting in their stances as they all turned their eyes to Robyn , who took an immense breath to steady her . \
  "  Here goes nothing !  "   Robyn shouted as she threw the ball up , keeping her eyes on it .  In a quick fit of nervousness , Robyn hesitantly hit the ball , barely getting it over the net .  From that point on it became a fearsome volleyball throw down ; the volley's flowed back and forth for minutes on end during each serve , adding to its intensity .  Giving it their all , both Corryn and Robyn went for successful serves as their easiest way of scoring , but somehow they were constantly overthrown by the other members of the teams . \
The front liners were especially aggressive , stuffing each other in the face to keep the ball from making its way over the net .  With a score of 4 to 4 , it was Corryn's turn to serve as she gazed down the opposing team .  Throughout the course of the match , she had been analyzing the team's strong points and the team's weak points .  Gazing at Nowi , she licked her lips tossing the ball up into the air .  Instead of a regular wait period for the ball to drop , Corryn instead leapt up and smashed her fist into the ball , fiercely launching it over the net and over Ylisse's front line . \
  "  Nowi heads up !  "   Chrom called as Nowi's eyes watched the ball come her way .  For some reason her reaction times were a bit slower than the rest of the team's making her the easiest target to score against .  Analyzing what Corryn had performed on her serve , an idea immediately sparked in her mind . \
  "  Frederick get back here and help Nowi up into the air , I'll set up a high volley !  "   Robyn said , immediately shoving Nowi towards Frederick to barely knick the ball up .  As Chrom backed up the volley to keep it in the air , Nowi finally understood what Robyn was trying to achieve .  Quickly placing her foot into Federick's cupped hands , Nowi leapt up into the air as Frederick used his strength to toss her up to the high volley that Chrom set up .  She immediately flexed her body back , and then flailed forward , hitting the ball as hard as she could with hand .  She easily shot over the capable hands of the front line , zipping over Leo's shoulder before kicking up a cloud of sand on impact .  Federick caught Nowi , gently placing her back onto the sand carefully .  Nowi shouted , hopping up and down in excitement as she gave Robyn a leaping hug around her neck . \
  "  THAT WAS GREAT ! That was so exciting !  "   Nowi cheered as Robyn gave a laugh , setting her back onto her feet before looking back at the astonished faces of the Nohrian royals . \
  "  That was so cool ! We need to try something like that next !  "   Elise said , stretching a bit while the other sighed at one another . \
  "  Brother we need to get ourselves together if we're going to overcome this obstacle ,  "   Leo said giving Xander's arm a nudge .  Xander sighed then smiled at Leo as he shrugged his shoulder . \
  "  I must say it's certainly proving to be more difficult than leading an army .  Compared to all of you I'm not pulling my weight nearly as much .  Niles smirked then gave Xander a hard slap on the back , catching a bit of his developing sunburn .  Xander gasped in pain as his eyes glared at Niles . \
  "  Come on what's with the pity party ? It's first one to ten remember ? We've got plenty of time to get back at 'em ,  "   he said , picking up the volleyball and pitching it to Corryn .  Corryn smiled and gave a nod . \
  "  That's exactly right , so loosen up everyone ; you aren't going to play well if you aren't having fun !  "   Corryn shouted , clapping for everyone to get back into position .  The other side of the net was laughing at their seriousness , doing their best to keep their tongues to themselves to not provoke them .  Robyn smirked at Corryn , who was grinning back at her as she delivered a serve without delay .  Taking a few steps back , Sully popped the ball up into the air , giving Gaius the perfect opportunity to hammer the ball over the net .  The loud pounding noise of Gaius hitting the ball was quickly quieted by a fit of shouting as Effie leapt into the air , using her powerful arms to reject the hard hit back at them , clocking Chrom in the face with the ball .  Chrom fell back into the sand as the ball followed suit , Frederick immediately helping him back to his feet . \
  "  Are you alright Chrom ?  "   Federick asked , noticing how his face was now red from the volleyball hitting his face to so hard .  Chrom shook off the pain and popped his neck giving Federick a nod in response . \
  "  Yeah , yeah I'm fine , that just hurt a bit .  I'm good ,  "   Chrom said as he shook the sand from his body .  Effie shot a smirk back at Elise who cheered for her success as praise .  From then on it was a vicious throw down of spikes , rejections , serves and cheers with Kiran and Robin doing their best to keep it safe and clean .  As the ball hit the Ylisse's sand once more , the tying point came up , signifying that the game came down to this last serve .  Robyn took a deep breath as she fought through her exhaustion .  Everyone at this point was running out of breath , trying to keep themselves steady as the game slowly came to its conclusion .  The sun began to set as the two teams eyed one another , ready to risk life and limb over a game of volleyball .  Robyn's vision began to blur as she continued to try and shake off the exhaustion and mild dehydration , every inch of her energy determined to get the score herself to make her move on Corryn .  Robyn , finally steadying herself , threw the ball up into the air , hitting it with all her might over the net . \
A series of careful pop ups and volleys made for a tricky tactic as the ball finally made its way to Xander to leap and spike it down .  Lucina dove into the sand , barely hitting it back up into play where Nowi and Lissa could keep up the volley .  They set up Sully for a hit , allowing her to try and power it through the front keepers , but Effie yet again rejected the ball sending it towards the ground .  Gaius thought quickly , diving off to the side to keep the ball from narrowly escaping their grasp .  Lucina popped it up from there , this time giving Frederick the opportunity to hammer the ball over the net .  With a strong pounding noise , Frederick gave the hit everything he got , sending the ball flying like a fast ball at Elise who had lost her footing .  Camilla charged in front of Elise , bending forward to catch the powerful hit with her wrists to hit it up once again .  Corryn saw this as her chance to try and get the point herself , remembering the bet that she had made with Robyn . \
  "  Leo , volley it my way !  "   Corryn shouted as the ball headed towards Leo .  Leo grinned as he got his hands on it , pushing it in Corryn's direction as she made a charge .  With a leap from the dash , she hit it as hard as she could , the ball shooting past the frontline and towards the middle back .  Nowi and Lissa made a swat for the ball but missed , leaving only Lucina and Robyn to save the game . \
  "  I got it !  "   Lucina called out , hitting it back up with a loud popping noise .  Robyn , in that instant , saw her last chance to succeed .  Throughout the whole game Robyn had been the most hit or miss player on the field and but now was her time for her to shine .  Gaius saw Robyn running towards him as he slowly tried to get up out of the sand ; he smirked at Robyn then got on his hands and knees , giving Robyn a pedestal to leap off of to hit the ball at a better angle . \
  "  Take this !  "   Robyn shouted as she launched off of Gaius's back .  She used what energy she had left , using both of her hands to smack it down over the net .  Chrom had to snatch Robyn out of the air to keep her from hitting the net , causing her to fall back into him as the ball soared through the air .  It managed to sneak through Effie's and Nile's hands , sending it plummeting towards the middle of their whole formation .  Corryn desperately attempted to hit it back up , diving for it into the sand with all of her determination .  Corryn then sighed and smiled as she saw the ball miss her hands by mere inches , hitting the sand with a loud poof .  There was an eruption of cheers as both teams were finally able to catch their breaths .  The Nohrian team wiped the sweat from their brows and smirked at the victors , giving a sigh of both relief and dismay as all the on lookers piled on the Ylisse side of the net . \
  "  Good job everyone , we all did our best .  If we are ever to return to this beach under these conditions , we'll be sure to take victory home ,  "   Xander said with a chuckle as they all decided to join the mob of people .  Corryn found a hand waiting for her as she rose out of sand , a smiling and exhausted Robyn looking down at her . \
  "  Good game ,  "   Robyn said , blushing and grinning as Corryn took her hand .  Corryn nearly dragged Robyn into the dirt as she hoisted up with Robyn's grip .  Once they were both balanced and back on their feet , Robyn then began to run away from the mob of people , dragging Corryn with her .  The both of them laughed and smiled as Robyn led them along , not knowing or caring where they would end up .  Finding a small cove at the edge of the water , Robyn headed in that direction .  As she grew close she lost her footing , falling onto her back with a splash with Corryn falling on top of her .  Robyn's face glowed bright red as Corryn looked down at her with a smile .  In her mind she knew it was now or never with her so close to her now . \
With only minimal hesitation , Robyn wrapped her arms around Corryn's neck , pulling her in to plant a soft kiss on her lips .  At first Corryn stared in shock at the bold gesture that Robyn had made .  This wasn't normal in even the slightest , slowly but surely however , she began to understand why Robyn acted the way that she did around her .  It wasn't like Corryn was opposed to such a thing nor did she have any particular interest in gender ; this was just a first for her when it came to things such as love .  Corryn then lovingly cradled the back of Robyn's head with her hands , breathing heavily as her body grew hot .  As their lips parted , the both found themselves panting heavily , there faces both red with their eyes locked on one another's . \
  "  S-Sorry\'85I shouldn't have just done that\'85I should've asked how y-you felt first or something\'85  "   Robyn's eyes filled with guilt as the now anxious Corryn seized Robyn's lips in response .  It was just like a dream that Robyn had weeks ago , only this time it was very real .  The disbelief and utter surprise that made Robyn's heart flutter made her heart pound in her chest nervously ; slowly sliding her hands down Corryn's back .  Corryn smiled helplessly as she pulled her face away . \
  "  I-I don't know what came over me either , I guess that means I-I like it right ?  "   Corryn's words shook as Robyn found herself grasping around Corryn's waist , her trembling body now rubbing up against Corryn's .  Corryn got off of Robyn , breaking her hold on her as she sat up .  Robyn's continued to gaze nervously at Corryn , wondering if each thing she had done was either good or bad .  Robyn then followed suit , sitting up next to her as they both continued to blush heavily . \
  "  I've never done anything like this before so I'm a little nervous .  But um\'85I really like the feeling , and you know , you are really attractive Robyn .  I'm rather jealous of your delicate looks as opposed to mine that are a bit more\'85boorish ,  "   Corryn said with a shy smile .  Robyn leaned up against her , resting her head on her shoulder as they rubbed their legs against one another . \
  "  But you're so beautiful Corryn , I could never compare to your body or your personality\'85I'm just that shy girl that doesn't belong anywhere except on the battlefield .  When I strategize , when I battle , that's when I feel my confidence flourish .  But outside of that\'85I'm rather dull and lacking you know ?  "   Robyn sighed softly as Corryn let a short laugh out .  At this point Robyn was getting dizzy from anxiousness with her bodies temperature rising drastically by the moment .  Corryn on the other hand felt hot and bothered but in a more positive sense .  All she knew was that this feeling that she had for Robyn made her feel good , and she was ready to explore that feeling further . \
  "  Hey I've got an idea .  Let's compare our chest sizes , then you'll see you aren't so lacking ,  "   Corryn grinned as she reached behind Robyn , yanking her bikini lace so that Robyn's top practically fell off .  Robyn tensed up and yelped in surprise , immediately covering her chest with her arms to keep her bikini on her .  Corryn let out a giggle as she moved around so that she was on her knees in front of Robyn .  Robyn's eyes widened as Corryn did the same , except she did it without any fear or shamefulness .  Slowly she slid her bikini off until her naked breasts were revealed to Robyn . \
  "  See ? It's no big deal .  You can trust me Robyn .  You have them just like I do so stop hiding yourself OK ?  "   Corryn insisted , making Robyn nod shyly .  Robyn slowly lowered her arms , allowing Corryn to remove it from her .  Corryn laid it off to the side as Robyn released her chest completely .  Robyn shut her eyes as he face lit up , scared of what kind of remarks that Corryn might make . \
  "  Robyn , you are absolutely beautiful and your chest isn't lacking at all .  You shouldn't be so insecure in yourself ,  "   Corryn smiled , her kind words inviting Robyn to open her eyes .  Robyn smiled shyly as a large grin spread across Corryn's face . \
  "  Y-You're beautiful too Corryn .  Y-You're the most beautiful girl I've ever met and your chest is still much bigger than my own\'85may I\'85um\'85may I touch them ?  "   Robyn's heart was pounding violently in her chest as she grew bolder as their interactions went further .  Corryn's eyes grew seductive as she gently grasped onto to Robyn's wrists .  Slowly , she slid Robyn's hands over her breasts , releasing them to allow her to do as she wished . \
  "  I'm sorry if this is weird , I just\'85I\'85I've always wanted a more endowed chest , so I want to feel yours to see what it would be like ,  "   Robyn smiled as she gently rubbed around Corryn's breasts , giving them an occasional loving squeeze .  Corryn's smile never left her face as she closed her eyes , now gasping and moaning gently from Robyn's touch .  Robyn's body shivered as Corryn left herself vulnerable to Robyn's advances . \
Robyn gulped in the pit of her throat as she slowly moved her body forward , gently pressing her lips against Corryn's breast carefully .  Corryn let out another gasp as she allowed Robyn to advance further , the excitement of another's touching making her feelings run wild .  Robyn moaned as well as her lips partook in each of Corryn's breasts before moving down her body .  Robyn slowly helped Corryn onto her back as Robyn's heart pounding exploration took flight .  Robyn found herself biting her thumbnail as she came to Corryn's crotch , her nerves shaking her as she debated if she should try and go that far .  Corryn moaned as her hands found their way to Robyn's head , gently stroking her hair as she pushed downward .  Robyn gasped as Corryn pressed down , forcing Robyn's mouth up against her soaked crevice through her bikini bottom . \
Robyn took a curious whiff of Corryn's crotch , her scent causing Robyn to feel dizzy with its potency .  Corryn sat up slightly so she could watch Robyn as she smelled her crotch , giggling softly from the display .  Corryn reached down and untied the side ties of her bikini bottom , moving her bikini away from her now exposed pussy that Robyn couldn't help but to stare at .  She noticed that she was incredibly smooth , as if she tended to her bodily hygiene in even such a strange place .  The smell became too much for Robyn to handle , causing her body to act instinctively on her own .  Robyn immediately smooshed her lips into Corryn snatch , her voice moaning helplessly as she took in Corryn's taste .  Corryn's grasp broke through her closed lips , causing a soft yet audible cry to reach Robyn's ears . \
  "  T-That feels good\'85keep going Robyn ,  "   Corryn beckoned affectionately , running her hands through Robyn's hair to assure her of her words .  Corryn then suddenly pressed down on Robyn's head , forcing her lips and now tongue to dig deeply into her crevice .  Robyn used her hands to separate Corryn's legs further , moaning and whimpering as her tongue began to thrash into and against Corryn's pleasure .  Corryn helplessly moved her hips into Robyn's lips , forcing Robyn's tongue deep .  Robyn felt Corryn's body tremble uncontrollably with her voice following ; she was now grinding her shaft helplessly into Robyn's lips , desperate for relief as Robyn partook in her taste .  Corryn finally let out a loud cry as she clenched onto Robyn's hair aggressively , locking her legs around her head .  Robyn paused with her tongue inside Corryn , letting her do as she pleased until she was satisfied . \
Corryn's loud cry seemed to attract the attention of the person responsible for searching for the two of them .  Robin wandered over to where they were , hiding behind a rock as he watched in disbelief .  He wanted to call out to them , but it was clearly the wrong time to do such a thing .  Corryn lifted Robyn's face from her pussy , immediately pulling Robyn up on her to kiss her aggressively .  Robin's face grew red and his body heated up ; it reminded him of when he was Cecilia in the library the other night .  He couldn't believe what he was seeing , or how it was clearly affecting him .  Corryn raised up her leg , cupping Robyn rough , moist crotch , in which made Robyn tremble and cry into Corryn's mouth .  As their tongues and lips danced wildly with one another , the warm , moist feeling of Robyn cunt began to desperately glide up and down Corryn's leg , her body and voice growing wild as she lost herself in the fit of lust .  Robin covered his mouth and covered his hand over his crotch , trying to fight the shame of feeling this way for someone other than Cecilia from the night before . \
  "  D-Don't stop , don't stop ! Stay there !  "   Robyn cried as her body shook viciously , her pussy attacking Corryn's leg violently as their tongues continued to dance with one another .  Robyn then gripped her arms tightly around Corryn's neck , shoving her lips up against Corryn's so that she could scream in her mouth as she came abruptly from the experience .  Robin was going to leave them be by making a retreat until he stepped on a smile pile of branches .  The snapping sounds and the sounds of him hitting the sand startled Robyn while simply grabbing the attention of Corryn .  Corryn grinned as she gently stroked Robyn's hair , causing her to relax and to rest her face into her chest . \
  "  Gods ! I am sorry to disturb the two of you\'85Kirin asked me to come look for the two of you .  He said he was worried about the both of you and wanted to make sure you were OK .  Now that I see you're OK I'll leave !  "   Robin said ready to hustle out of the cove when Corryn decided to beckon to him . \
  "  Robin , would you care to join us ? I'm curious about what it's like to get intimate with a man ,  "   Corryn giggled , causing Robin to stop dead in his tracks .  His heart and loins began to have a power struggle over his actions as her seductive , inviting words playback in his mind .  In defiance , Robin turned and sighed , shaking his head as he approached the two love birds . \
  "  Have you lost your mind Corryn ? You can't be doing this kind of thing out in the open like this , its uh\'85indecent\'85  "   Robin's face was flushed as he tried to avert eye contact from the two of them .  Robyn smiled and gently kissed Corryn's cheek , turning it to look in her eyes . \
  "  I\'85don't mind\'85he is um\'85me after all , so I guess it's OK if you do that with him .  I may\'85oh Gods\'85I'll join you too , so I can be involved with your love ,  "   Robyn said with a twinkle in her eyes .  Corryn grinned , kissing her lips gently before returning her gaze to Robin . \
  "  There you have it .  So come on , lighten up .  Think of it as making a special memory between us three .  After all , this has been such a memorable trip thus far ,  "   Corryn smiled gently moving from beneath Robyn to stand .  She slowly moved in on Robin , wrapping her arms around his neck before brushing his hair . \
  "  You are very handsome you know ,  "   Corryn smiled as Robin froze up .  Closer and closer nude body encroached , until it was finally pressed against his with her lips following suit .  Robin tried to break free of her grasp , but gave in to his hormones when Corryn reached down to rub over his curve beneath his swim trunks .  Corryn walked him back then helped onto his back , allowing him to rest in the sand as Corryn and Robyn stroked their curiosities .  He propped himself up on his elbows as the both of them lowered his trunks to his knees , revealing a rather sizeable appendage from between his legs .  The two of them blushed heavily at the sight of it , gently rubbing their fingers over it to probe . \
  "  It's twitching\'85does that mean it feels good ?  "   Corryn asked , now rubbing her palm along its curve .  Robin gasped and moaned as Robyn joined in , gently rubbing her finger over the tip of his member . \
  "  Y-Yeah it feels good\'85  "   Robin stuttered as the two girls continued to play with his dick with grand curiosity . \
  "  I wonder what it tastes like\'85  "   Robyn said , nervously slipping out the tip of her tongue .  Robin's face turned bright red as he watched his female counterpart glide her tongue up and down the upper part of his curve while Corryn began to stroke it . \
  "  I want to taste it too ,  "   Corryn giggled , lowering her face down with Robyn's .  Robin gripped the sand and began to tremble vigorously as the two girls began pleasuring him orally , his moans and whimpers slowly growing out of control . \
  "  Hehe , I think he likes it ,  "   Robyn giggled as she replaced her tongue with her lips , kissing up it until she was at the tip as Corryn followed with her tongue .  They blushed and smiled at one another as they began to give each other sloppy kisses around the head of his cock , causing Robin to lose his mind . \
  "  W-W-Wait s-slow down ! I'm g-going to cum if this keeps up !  "   Robin whined helplessly as the two girl continued , wrapping their tongue around one another over his tip .  Corryn began to stroke his now moist length , moaning and panting into Robyn's lips . \
Robin suddenly stiffened up , covering his mouth as he let out a cry of pleasure .  Thick , white fluids began to flow from his tip , causing the two girls to curiously lick it all up with every little pulse of release .  Some of his seed shot up onto Robyn's cheek before Corryn surrounded his whole head with her mouth , pinching the bottom of it with his lips .  They refused to let up , causing Robin to yell and scream like a helpless puppy .  He clenched his hand over his mouth as tightly as he could as the two girls slowly finished up .  Corryn giggled , licking the small bit of semen off of Robyn's cheek before turning her attention to Robin . \
  "  A bit salty for me\'85but not too bad .  You don't taste as good as Robyn does ,  "   Corryn playfully stuck her tongue out , making Robyn giggle and causing Robin to look to the side shamefully .  Corryn swallowed the remainder of his load , licking her lips playfully as Robyn switched with Corryn , moving up on him . \
  "  Would you like to taste me too ?  "   Robyn suggested , gently sitting on his chest with her moist crotch only inches away from his face .  Robin continued to whimper as Corryn began stroking his member , wondering if it would grow big again if she applied friction .  Sure enough , within a matter of minutes , Robin was hard once more , unwillingly ready for another round .  Finding that he had no escape , he willingly accepted her offer , giving her a nod before opening his mouth . \
  "  O-Oh OK\'85but what is Corryn d-doing down there\'85it feels\'85strange\'85  "   Robin whined , now staring in disbelief as Corryn slowly lowered her drenched cunt to the head of his member .  Robin threw his head back and let out a loud gasp as Corryn's pussy clenched his cock tightly as it was sheathed by her crotch .  Corryn let out a whine as well , her face drenched with sweat with a little saliva oozing from the corner of her mouth . \
  "  Th-this feels incredible , I-I'm going to move now OK ?  "   Corryn stuttered as she slowly rose up from his member , her tight crevice being lightly stretched by his girth .  She then let her weight fall back onto it , causing her to cry out in pleasure .  Robyn couldn't help but to giggle into Corryn's shameless , moaning face , now kissing her passionately as she rested her moist crotch against Robin's lips . \
  "  You're so cute with that face Corryn , I can't explain it but I want you now  "   Robyn moaned , leaning forward to kiss and lick against Corryn's breasts as she moved on Robin's member .  Robin began to find it hard to breath as Robyn smothered her crevice into his mouth harshly , his tongue being forced up deeply into it , causing her to tremble in lust .  The deafening sounds of depravity echoed within the cove as the three of them engaged in the carnal activity .  Corryn held Robyn's head to her chest as she pleasured it , the strange sensation of Robin's length twitching and throbbing within the confines of her crotch . \
Robin's muffled cries caused Robyn's insides to vibrate ; causing her to cry out as well as her body began tensing up .  Corryn found her body shivering as well as a strange sensation overtook her ; it was a similar feeling she felt compared with Robyn's release from Corryn's leg .  Corryn's eyes shot open in surprise as a thick , warm fluid began to pour into her nether region , causing her to keep Robin's member deep inside of her as it released .  Robyn gently sucked on Corryn's panting tongue before removing herself from Robin's face .  Robin's breathing grew heavy as his poor body felt broken and used , his energy leaving him in an instant as he tried to move .  Robyn leaned down , gently kissing Robin's lips as the remainder of his seed filled her to the brim . \
  "  I-I\'85I came inside of Corryn\'85Gods\'85it felt good .  .  .   "   Robin thought to himself as Corryn sighed contently .  As she raised her vaginal hole from Robin's member , his seed began to ooze out of her crevice , drizzling back down onto his cock in which it came . \
  "  That was a lot\'85that must mean he really liked it\'85  "   Robyn said with a giggle .  As she rose off , Robyn took it upon herself to clean off his member , causing a spurt of cum to shoot against her lips and nose .  She flinched in surprise then laughed as she sucked off all the remaining cum from his member , swallowing it all to remove any evidence of their activities .  Corryn's exhaustion finally overcame her as she fell to the sand , her head pounding right into Robyn's lap as she sat there .  Robyn whipped off her face then gently stroked Corryn's hair , now lightly humming a tune that Lucina had hummed for her once before on a restless night .  Robin couldn't do anything but to stare at the sky , his thoughts racing through his mind as he tried to compile all of the events into single thoughts . \
  "  This sun feels nice\'85  "   Robin said softly , returning his trunks to their rightful place as he began to nap in the sand .  The three of them stayed quiet about the events of that day over the course of their training .  Robyn and Corryn never stopped smiling at one another while Robin couldn't look either of them in the face without a guilty conscious , smiling out of sight in honor of their happy memory .  All in all it was a wonderful experience that the three of them would never forget for the rest of their lives . \
  "  Mark , you should really get your head out of that book and get to know your fellow soldiers .  It has been at least a week since we were summoned here and you aren't taking notice of anything that's going on ,  "   Eliwood groaned as he took notice of Mark reading the same book he had read for the third time now .  In all the time that he had known Mark , Eliwood knew without a doubt that he was often quiet and kept to himself when his services were not required on the battlefield ; but he also knew that he was very kind and outgoing as well , which Eliwood believed should be greater shown .  Thinking about something that could shake Mark free of his hermit behavior had proven to be quite the task considering he hadn't gotten much feedback on the matter . \
  "  Its not that I haven't been taking note of my surroundings , I just haven't been necessary for any battles since we've arrived in this place .  So because I haven't been on the battlefield at all I haven't found a need to get to know any of the others ,  "   Mark quickly dismissed Eliwood's allegations , causing Eliwood to think of a more direct approach to question Mark with .  This wasn't the first time he had seen Mark like this so he had an idea or two to get Mark out in the open .  A smile graced his face as he reached forward , grabbing the top of Mark's book before yanking it from his hands . \
Eliwood curiously watched Mark as he placed his hands on his lap , his face turning a slight hint of red beneath his hood .  Eliwood turned the book around and saw something a bit more interesting than words .  Apparently the book wasn't a novel book at all ; it was an inscribing grimoire that Mark had been drawing in ever since they had arrived .  The most curious thing that Eliwood noticed when flipping through it was a lot of drawings of the female tenants that were within the ranks of the army .  Eliwood was more impressed by the drawings themselves than the subject matter , but regardless , it gave Eliwood all the information he needed .  He smirked and closed the book , handing it back to Mark who had grown quite flustered . \
  "  I see , so you're just nervous to speak to the women of this place .  I can certainly imagine why since their appearances and physiques are all very impressive ; I've yet to see a single female within these walls that was anything short of corrigible .  It isn't like you haven't ever spoken to a member of the opposite sex before\'85are you afraid you have nothing to offer them Mark ?  "   Eliwood smirked , throwing Mark's hood off of his head , revealing his disheveled brown locks and a disgruntled face . \
  "  Its not so much that I don't have anything to offer , but there are so many more brave , masculine , and smarter warriors here than myself .  Call it insecurity if you must , but until I'm forced into mingling with them for battle , I plan to just keep my distance , watching as I sketch out the world around me ,  "   Mark replied , sighing softly as he pocketed his inscribing grimoire . \
  "  I noticed that you fancy the more\'85voluptuous women here from the glance I saw of your drawings .  Why don't you walk around and actually speak to one or two of them instead of gazing from a far ? You do realize if any of them caught sight of you casually sketching them that they are going to think one of two ways : That it is either flattering or it makes them incredibly uncomfortable .  Having spoken to a number of them myself , I've found that they are all quite sincere and easy to approach , so I don't think there is anything for you to fear ,  "   Eliwood offered his hand to help Mark off the floor , which he took without hesitation . \
Upon rising to his feet , Mark let out a sigh but followed it up by a smile .  Eliwood was certainly one of his closest friends that he had made in the many of years that he had been a strategist so he knew he could trust him and his words .  Eliwood gave him a pat on the back , walking the opposite direction that Mark's feet now carried him .  He honestly had no idea why he had been so nervous up to this point .  After all he had spoken to a plentiful number of females within their group , and that includes the dragon Ninian , which most people would typically shy away from merely because her origins alone .  Mark eventually chalked it up to him being in an unfamiliar environment , which he decided that he was going to change as of this moment .  Meanwhile , various courtships , conversations and group discussions were gathered all over the Askrian barracks today . \
Various warriors from various worlds were all coming together in a giant collective to discuss all subject matters that ever existed .  However , there were those who , much like Mark didn't care much for things such as those or found them irrelevant , superfluous and unnecessary to say the least .  A particular case of this nature was found sighing in the hall .  Finding herself nothing short of unfulfilled , Kagero decided to go and try to gather supplies to take part in one of her little hidden joys in life : painting .  Unfortunately , ever since she had arrived ; she had only the slightest chance to speak to Lord Ryoma before he decided to order her to get a long with the other warriors in the vicinity and on top of that supplies of artistic nature mostly came in the form of clothing material . \
Kagero stood in the shade of a pillar as she thought to herself on where supplies may be .  That's when she recalled one of the times when she had taken to her ninja reconnaissance by habit , gathering data on everyone within the barracks .  She had noticed a peculiar strategist dressed in green who often was using art materials to construct the world around him via his notebook of sorts .  Still having failed to learn most of the other tenant's names , Mark removed his grimoire from his pocket and began looking over the various females in which he had drawn from a far .  He noticed that there were a few that he had drawn more than a few times , unaware at the time that he had been doing it . \
  "  A ninja with interesting onyx hair and a pink uniform with a long yellow scarf .  .  . and a princess with very wild , yet attended lilac hair with very bold black armor that was nothing short of revealing\'85I can't believe I hadn't noticed how much I have observed these two ,  "   Mark looked in a strange sense of amazement as he kept flipping through the pages of his grimoire .  As he went to pocketing it once more , he noticed that one of the two subjects , the one with the pink uniform and yellow scarf had appeared before him out of what seemed to be thin air .  Mark's face grew warm at the blatant sight of Kagero sudden appearance as well as her sizable chest creating vast cleavage at the top of her uniform .  He shook his head for a quick moment to try and shake his nerves off . \
  "  Excuse me , I've noticed that you are often drawing in that book of yours\'85could you tell me where I could find supplies for artwork ? I've been searching for some time and have not yielded any desirable results ,  "   Kagero asked bluntly .  The fact that she was asking about something that was in relation to one of his personal hobbies gave him the impression that he could certainly use this encounter to become acquainted with one of his favorite subjects . \
  "  I had no idea that ninja's did anything else besides guarding their lords , this is quite the pleasant surprise .  I would be more than happy to lead you to where I get my supplies .  I've seen you around the barracks quite a few times now , so do you mind if I ask for your name ?  "   Mark put on a gentleman's charm , which to Kagero seemed like nothing more than a frivolous formality .  Seeing no harm in sharing some bits of information , Kagero smiled faintly as she walked at his side . \
  "  My name is Kagero .  I am the loyal retainer of Lord Ryoma , King of the Hoshido .  I've seen you around the barracks number of times as well ; you don't seem to have very much presence if you'll pardon me saying so .  What is your name ?  "   Kagero's words caused a slight pain in his side as if stabbed , but immediately recovered without showing signs of discomfort in her dialog . \
  "  My name is Mark .  I was taken in by a woman named Lyn when I lost my memory and was inducted into the army that was led by Eliwood and Hector of Ostia .  They are two of my greatest allies and also the Godparent to their children .  I'm not necessarily in service to them of course , especially not now .  The three of us have become best friends as well as bound by duty as comrades in battle .  It is a pleasure to meet you Kagero .  So tell me , what has you so interested in the arts ?  "   Mark inquired after his drawn out introduction .  He felt quite foolish for revealing everything that he did but he noticed that Kagero didn't pay mind to his strong front , which made him feel relieved . \
  "  It's a way that I can feel at peace .  Being bound by duty can often weigh heavily on ones heart and mind .  When I lost Lady Mikoto , the queen of Hoshido , my heart became very heavy and my wits grew dull .  It wasn't until my new lord ; Lord Ryoma suggested that I try to find a hobby of sorts to be at ease .  That's when I discovered that I found much joy and peace of mind in painting .  I'm\'85not the talented one for it , but I don't believe in competition when it comes to activities of leisure .  So tell me , Mark , what did you find in the arts that made you fall for its charms as well ?  "   Kagero replied .  Mark was taken by surprise by her reason , making him feel a little bit more than inadequate in his following reason for partaking in the arts himself . \
  "  When Eliwood and Hector found me , I had lost most of my memories .  One of the very few things that I remembered was that I enjoyed looking at sky , the vast mountains and the plains that surrounded me on all sides .  So I thought that maybe if I start drawing what I see in the world around me , that I wouldn't have to worry if I were to lose my memory again because I could look back and see the things that I had drawn .  I can't say it's nearly as impressive as your endeavor in finding the arts , but I am proud to say that I have become quite good at it ,  "   Mark said with a smile as they continued on .  As random as their encounter was , it was the first time that either one of them really opened up , especially being strangers at first .  Mark's joy turned to a small sway of nervousness as Kagero asked a favor of him . \
  "  May I see your drawing book ? I'm very curious as to what things you've seen around this place that you have drawn ,  "   Kagero asked , noticing his grimoire in his pocket .  Mark felt pale as a cold sweat formed on his back ; not only was one of the most visually appealing subjects to him by his side , but she wanted to see the things that he had drawn .  Fortunately , none of his art was of a more bold variety , but the different number of females drawn didn't vastly differ , clearly showing his interests in who he enjoyed drawing .  Hesitantly , he reached into his coat's pocket , pulling out the medium sized grimoire and nervously handed it to her as they walked .  Carefully she opened it from the first page , slowly thumbing through it silently as he led her to the barrack's general supply store . \
Mark couldn't help but to dart his eyes over to Kogero periodically as she thumbed through it , praying that she didn't find his subject matters and choices to be lecherous or something of a similar nature .  To his surprise , he actually caught a smile or two with his eyes ; Kagero didn't see his art for what he believed it was ; she saw it as it was intended to be seen , which was than a relief to him . \
  "  Tell me Mark , about these drawings here\'85are these images that you have drawn of me ?  "   Kagero pointed out , causing Mark to sigh and blush lightly .  She had finally found what he was so nervous about , so it was time to let the truth out .  Mark turned his eyes to her , smiling softly into them . \
  "  They are indeed of you , Kagero .  Although I didn't know your name or where you came from , your appearance has always caught my eye whenever I was to pass you in these halls .  Your looks , your physique , your presence , all of these things aren't anything short of perfect in my eyes , especially as a subject for my art .  I know you probably think it silly of me , or even dastardly to a higher extent , but I find you to be one of the most visually appealing individuals I have ever had the privilege of laying my eyes on ,  "   Mark said , his face now red a strawberry .  Although his face was clearly flustered , Kagero could tell that every word he was saying wasn't anything short of the truth .  Mark clearly wasn't trying to make a pass at her , nor was he trying to be anything short of a professional .  A light blush made its way onto Kagero's cheeks as she finished thumbing through it , gently handing it back to him as they arrived at their destination . \
  "  They are quite good , and to be honest , I am completely taken by surprise with your kind words about me\'85I do not believe I deserve such affectionate words nor have I ever been referred to as visual perfection before , much less it being announced in front of my very eyes .  Perhaps we should meet again at some point when we have more time and\'85share our art again , perhaps even do some art together if you aren't opposed to the thought ,  "   Kagero said , smiling at him as he gave a confirming nod in response .  Mark decided it was best to leave her on that note , allowing her to browse the store at her own leisure as he went on his way to find another one of his subjects to perhaps share a word with . \
  "  That was surprisingly easy , maybe Eliwood was right and I just need to open up .  I even openly confessed to her without thinking about it\'85I guess I have more to offer than I thought ,  "   Mark said with a smile as he came upon a small group of individuals .  Before him was his other favorite subject , intermingling with her family and friend as it were .  Mark saw this is as a fine opportunity to draw out some more art , this time trying to catch the whole encounter on parchment .  It was the lilac haired beauty that was standing before his eyes .  With her was a young man clad all in white and blue armor with a young woman with bright red hair next to him , holding his hand .  He found a nice pillar to stoop next to and began drawing out what was playing before his very eyes . \
  "  So , I take it you two have been doing well ? I haven't really seen either of you for almost a week now .  Let me guess , you two just refuse to leave Hinoka's room don't you ?  "   Camilla teased , causing both Corrin and Hinoka to blush profusely . \
  "  I-It's\'85well\'85yes .  We have been spending a lot of time in my room so to speak\'85  "   Hinoka shyly smiled , holding onto Corrin's arm as she let out the truth .  Camilla couldn't help but to giggle at the two love birds that were apparently going at it like rabbits behind closed doors .  After he did the base sketch of the scene , he then turned away from them , now sketching and shading down details to really bring the piece to life .  He got so involved in detailing Camilla in his sketch that he didn't realize the shadow of the individual in question looming over him . \
  "  Gods\'85her beautiful hairs are always such a struggle to shade correctly\'85but I dare say I'm doing a fairly swell job this time ,  "   Mark mumbled to himself , prompting for a dainty black gauntlet hand to gently pinch the book at its crease .  Mark looked up to see his gorgeous subject smiling down at him , her curious yet naturally seductively looks causing him to shiver with an odd sense of fear .  He peeked around to her side and noticed that the other two individuals had vanished . \
  "  Well if it isn't the green strategist , you're certainly a sneaky one aren't you ? And what do we have here I wonder ?  "   Camilla said playfully , yanking the book from his hands .  He tried to get a good grip on it , but her strength was far greater than his own . \
  "  I uh .  .  . I'm not trying to be sneaky , I-I just really like to draw from life , that's all !  "   Mark panicked as his fright from Camilla's sudden appearance took flight .  She seemed to be looking over the images much more intently than he thought she would , smiling and giggling at multiple portions of the book .  He could tell that she had stumbled across the series of images he had draw of her from the expression of her seductive eyes shifting to his own . \
  "  These pictures of me are absolutely darling ! Tell me , why are there so many of myself in here ? This is far from a complaint I assure you ,  "   Camilla's sultry words made Mark shake , causing him to shake his head to free himself from her overpowering presence . \
  "  Well ever since I arrived in Askr I've been taking note of the world around me .  I've been drawing everything that I find beautiful here in the barracks and you're one of the most beautiful women I have ever laid my eyes on .  I do hope I'm not giving off the wrong in impression ,  "   Mark sighed but smiled as Camilla's kind smile warmed his heart .  Thumbing until she came to an empty page , she couldn't help but to hand him back his notebook , placing her hands on his affectionately . \
  "  Aren't you just precious\'85telling me , what is your name handsome ?  "   Camilla winked her devilish charms working just as mark had seen many times before .  He smirked , putting on a face of confidence as he gazed back in her eyes . \
  "  My name is Mark ; I'm a tactician from Ostia .  And what is your name ?  "   Mark replied , chivalrously kissing the top of her hand like a gentlemen .  He remembered seeing Eliwood do this on various accounts when meeting female individuals and figured now was as good a time as any to emulate a fine gesture .  Eliwood once told him it's a sign of respect and that woman should be treated with the up most of such respect .  Camilla placed her other hand on her cheek as her face and smiled sweetly . \
  "  My , my , aren't you just the fiendish one .  I am Camilla , a crowned princess of Nohr .  So , Mark was it ? Tell me more about these drawings of me ; I'd like to hear some stories about them while I make my way to my other siblings .  That is , if you don't mind doing so ,  "   Camilla asked , leaving Mark to join her in a smile .  As they began down the hall , Camilla's voluptuous , intimidating presence slowly eased into a casual one as he began to explain the various places that he had drawn her . \
  "  This one right here was two days ago when I managed to see you laughing an impressive amount ; up to this point you had always looked so tired , so I was excited to see another emotion out of you .  This one to be honest I wasn't sure what you were up to , but you um\'85were in quite a suggestive pose .  Your body proportions are incredible so it certainly made my heart skip a beat\'85  "   Mark explained one image after another , quickly skimming through the book to the images of her that he had book marked .  Camilla noticed that she wasn't the only one he had drawn quite a few pictures of .  Only vaguely recognizing one of them , she decided to question him , hoping to get a reaction . \
  "  So\'85who is this woman here Mark ? It seems you have taken quite a fancy to her as well\'85  "   Camilla smirked , putting a pause on her words to make Mark feel awkward .  Mark sighed gently then smiled back at her , showing that he wasn't ashamed of what he had done . \
  "  Oh her , that is Kagero ; she's a ninja of Hoshido .  I've also found her to be quite the fine subject to draw since her proportions are much like your own .  I can't help but draw things that are truly beautiful , and there are numerous women here that are quite striking .  But the two of you are by far the finest models I have ever had ,  "   Mark laughed , causing Camilla to playfully gaze at him in return . \
  "  Who would you say is more beautiful Mark ? Is it that Kagero girl or me ?  "   Camilla's words took a squeeze on his heart , leaving him in a scary place within this questioning .  With a nervous gulp , he shut his grimoire and slid it into his pocket . \
  "  Between the two of you I can not choose one way or the other .  The only way I could further my aesthetic opinion would be if .  .  . I were to draw you both in a more private setting\'85  "   Mark word trailed off , trying his best to keep from saying a word too much that may upset the powerful goddess at his side .  Camilla paused her walking , immediately walking from Mark's side to gaze at him face to face . \
  "  What if I were to arrange such a meeting with you , myself and that Kagero woman ? Then would you be able to decide which of us is more beautiful ?  "   Camilla's competitive nature oozed out of her lips as she shot him a mischievous grin , proving that her words were going to be ringing true .  Mark's face lit on far as he averted his eyes shyly , smiling faintly as he thought about the proposal . \
  "  Yeah\'85I would be able to determine it that way\'85but you do know what I mean from a more private setting right ?  "   Mark's words shook as Camilla slowly began taking step after step towards him , lapping at her lips with her tongue as she grew closer and closer . \
  "  I'm very well aware of what you mean , Mr .  Artist .  Now\'85do we have a deal ? If I arrange for the three of us to meet in a more private setting , you would be able to determine who was more attractive , perhaps even being drawn up as proof ?  "   Camilla could never resist a challenge no matter how petty , awkward , suggestive or asinine as it could possibly be . \
  "  As enticing as that all sounds you really don't have to do something like that\'85I-I mean I'm not that kind of guy , I respect everyone and all and wouldn't ever dare impose on having women in my room with a lack of clothing on them\'85  "   Mark tried to turn the tide on the subject matter , but was rejected by Camilla walking him back up into a wall , pressing her chest to his as she loomed over him . \
  "  Aw\'85you have such sweet and innocent morals Mark\'85but think of it this way ; you aren't the one that is rudely provoking our behavior nor did you have any questionable intent about it all , no dear , it will be our choice to do so in front of you .  All you need to do is be the lucky boy that you are and look and judge , OK ?  "   Camilla's face with merely inches away , her ability to display sexual intensity overwhelming Mark's rational thought process . \
  "  I\'85I doubt Kagero would go through with this and I don't even know where she is or going to be , besides\'85she's a bit more modest and doesn't feel she has to prove anything\'85however , that being said , if you manage to get her to agree to such a crazy idea , I certainly wouldn't complain eh heh ,  "   Mark laughed awkwardly , provoking Camilla to ruffle his hair as she backed away . \
  "  That's more like it .  Just wait in your room tonight , and wait for a series of 4 knocks on your door .  Until then\'85enjoy your day ,  "   Camilla smiled , winking at him before turning away to walk in the other dimension .  At this point Mark's heart was pounding in his chest with his face flushed to the point of nearly passing out .  Mark felt dizzy and lightheaded as a result of Camilla's grand stand , leaving him dazed .  As he stumbled through the halls , his mind stuck on the idea of the two beauties being exposed in his room\'85for art's sake of course .  His lack of attention and loss of rational thought explained to him that he should go rest in his room the rest of the day ; gather his supplies , set up lighting , all the innocent things just in case this crazy plan were to bare fruit . \
  "  There's no way this is going to happen\'85for all I know she was just teasing me\'85  "   Mark said with a sigh as he made his way into his room .  Looking around he immediately groaned , forgetting about how neglected he'd been towards his room's upkeep , which now forced him into the position of cleaning his living space in the off chance that Camilla's ridiculous ploy would come to fruition .  After dusting and wiped down his floor , his room was completely spotless .  Even if no one showed up , he felt much better knowing that he wasn't sleeping in a pigsty .  After placing all of his art supplies in a neat and tidy corner , Mark felt as if he could just pass out from how much work it took to clean his quarters .  Consciousness left him before he knew it , leaving him to enjoy much needed rest after his emotional and mental escapades for the day .  Sure enough however , he found himself flinch awake at the loud sounds of banging on his door .  Mark paused , wondering if it was part of a dream he was having but then four bangs followed in its stead . \
  "  You've got to be kidding me\'85  "   Mark thought to himself , his body feeling hot and shaky as he slowly walked to the door .  Sure enough , upon opening the door , he was met with the faces of the two beauties that he had been waiting for .  They were both wearing finely crafted robes , not enough so to say they were sleeping wear but enough to fully cover their frames .  Camilla smiled and waved , opening the door to let herself in .  Behind her was Kagero , who for some reason seemed flustered with her face shaded with a hint of red .  After the two maidens came in , Mark plopped his rear on his head , shaking his head at how ridiculous this was . \
  "  Hey , just as promised .  Two models just for you to judge ,  "   Camilla's flirtatious voice made Mark shake a bit more , his eyes mostly focusing on Kagero's whose were almost just as flustered as his own . \
  "  I wonder what Camilla said to get Kagero to agree to this\'85  "   Mark thought to himself as Kagero and Camilla sat at both of his sides .  His blushing grew heavier as they gazed in his eyes , his immediate instinct now was to rise to his feet and step away from the beauties . \
  "  I-I'm glad you both came\'85I can't express how much of an honor this is .  I uh\'85I assure you this is strictly professional and not for some other questionable purpose .  OK , so , hmm\'85I guess the question is who wants to go first ?  "   Mark said , reaching and grabbing his grimoire from his dresser .  Without delay , Camilla was first to step right up .  As Mark went for his pencil , Camilla brushed her hair back so that it hung over the back of the robe as she slowly untied the waste .  His eyes lit up with amazement as her robe dropped to the ground ; Camilla grinned seductively at Mark as she stretched arms over her head to display her assets .  As expected she was wearing typical lingerie style wear , its style clearly showing off her dernier and bust .  He blushed heavily and smiled as he put his pencil to his tome , only to have his attention returned to the front as he felt a bra hit him in the face and the sound of fabric being tossed onto his bed .  He slowly removed the bra from his eyes , revealing Camilla in all of her glory .  Mark immediately clenched his legs together , his hand now trembling as Camilla struck a pose for him to draw . \
  "  You like what you see , don't you ?  "   Camilla snickered as Mark's shaky hands made art .  Camilla could be found blushing as well interestingly enough with each gaze of Mark's view ; as shrewd as she could be , never once had she ever been drawn before , which made this instance all the more exciting to her .  It took Mark no more than 10 minutes before he was done with the framework , which allowed his pounding heart to relax for a minute as he asked for Camilla to sit and Kagero to come forward .  Every time Kagero's eyes met with Mark's , her gaze would immediately shy away , her blushing cheeks bringing out her rather pale skin . \
  "  Sorry\'85I know this is probably crazy to you , I mean it is for me too\'85I didn't really want to do this , but\'85Camilla said that you really liked me and well , she thought that it would be a new experience for all of us to enjoy\'85  "   Kagero said with a faint smile , now undoing her waist sash as well .  Her eyes still insisted on gazing off to the side as her rob hit the floor , leaving Mark in complete awe as he gazed over her .  Unlike Camilla , her privates were covered by sashes and ties , as if she were more primitive in her upbringing .  Camilla expression was much more active at the sight of Kagero than herself , causing her to occasionally glance over at Mark in a strange , intimidating manor . \
Kagero then unraveled the back of her ties to unbind her shapely chest .  It poured out in front of his eyes as she immediately went to remove her bottoms as well .  She was like a gorgeous porcelain doll due to her pale skin .  Mark struggled to keep his legs clenched together as his hormones took over his body .  He tried to ignore the ever-growing appendage between his legs , now hiding it with his grimoire as he prepared his pencil .  Kagero's pose was very refined and tasteful , with her arm resting beneath her shapely breasts , gripping a hold of her other arm that hung loose .  She did her best to look him in the eyes while he sketched her out , her eyes retracting each time he looked away . \
  "  My word Kagero\'85I-I can't believe how amazing you are\'85  "   Mark softly said to himself as he finished up the small details to complete the image .  Camilla then rose to her feet , moving herself up next to Kagero to the point to where their chests were pushing up against one another's , as if sizing each other up to determine who was the victor .  Kagero flinched and tried to move away but Camilla quickly wrapped her arm around Kagero's waist to hold her still .  Mark immediately changed his page , quickly drawing up the two of them together as fast as he could .  He could tell that this was incredibly uncomfortable for Kagero so he did his best to move it along .  It wasn't long before he let out a soft sigh , laying his pencil within the crease of the grimoire . \
  "  A-Alright , all finished\'85  "   Mark said , his body easily telling the both of them that he was clearly aroused .  Kagero backed off from Camilla as she released her waist , leaving Kagero with the look of inadequate shame in her eyes .  He removed the first two drawings and evaluated them both before their eyes .  He then handed them to them to look for them ; he was surprised at how casual and civil this whole situation was . \
  "  So uh\'85what do you ladies think ?  "   Mark said , closing his grimoire and firmly planting his hands on it to try and subside his rapid growth beneath his trousers . \
  "  I think Camilla has the nicer body\'85  "   Kagero said , eyeing Mark almost shamefully as Camilla looked over Kagero's image carefully . \
  "  I don't know about that Kagero , look at how he drew his lines here .  I think you won this , not me ,  "   Camilla smirked , winking at Mark ; Mark couldn't tell what was going on as one supported the other , as if there was a more definitive reason for this situation to be taking place . \
  "  I guess that means it's another tie eh heh\'85  "   Mark said softly , prompting the two of them gaze into his eyes . \
  "  I think there's another way to tell who is bigger and better\'85  "   Camilla giggled , yanking Mark's grimoire away from him .  He immediately covered his crotch with his hands , shamefully looking to the side .  Camilla shook her head and forced his hands off of his crotch , revealing a rather modest bulge within his pants .  Kagero looked at his growth in astonishment instead of being overly shy ; it seemed that she was growing out of the shameful feeling of being naked and returning to her normal , cunning , and curious self that he had learned to like so much . \
  "  Alright , Mark dear , sit on the bed , we're going to give you another chance at telling us who is more attractive and better where it counts ,  "   Camilla said , her words drenched with lust as he agreed .  He slowly stepped over to the bed , plopping his rear down and looking up at the two of them . \
  "  What did you have in mind ?  "   Mark asked , his nerves steadily relaxing for a moment .  Camilla couldn't help but to smirk as Kagero made the first move this time .  Kagero moved down to Mark's level , blushing in his eyes as her face grew close to his .  She smiled and brushed his bangs to the side before kissing him softly , her hands lowering down his bottoms to reveal his anxious member .  Mark's eyes widened as he instantly gasped into her mouth , shaking as she retracted her lips from his . \
  "  W-What are you doing Kagero ? ! We don't even really know each other all that well\'85you\'85don't have to do this\'85  "   Mark's eyes shied away as Kagero laughed softly .  She turned his face with her hand , blushing heavily in his eyes as she smiled nervously . \
  "  You aren't the only one that feels this way Mark\'85women are no different than men when it comes down to things such as this when put in a situation like this ,  "   Kagero said with a smile as Camilla came down to their level . \
  "  Such a selfish man you are .  Thinking that you are forcing us into things\'85all you need to do is relax and enjoy .  It's no everyday a young man like you has two beautiful women clamoring for him , so stop over thinking it OK ?  "   Camilla smiled , causing Mark to go silent and nod gratefully .  Mark found himself hopelessly moaning and groaning as Camilla moved her chest up to Mark's lips , grasping behind his head to force his lips onto them as Kagero drained saliva from her tongue all over his now full erect member .  Mark's lips and tongue ran rampant , his instincts taking over as he savored the sweet smell and taste of Camilla's soft , succulent breasts in their entirety .  Camilla let loose soft , pleasurable gasps as she wrapped both of her arms around Mark's head to mash in between them .  Kagero blushed as she looked up at Camilla's well kept snatch and the moisture that was oozing from it as she pleasured Mark's member with her hand , stoking it and smiling with every moan she received from Mark in response . \
  "  Mmm\'85good\'85now that you've made them all moist , I have a special treat for you .  This if for doing such a good job on those drawings  "   Camilla teased lovingly , removing his face from her chest and planting a fat , wet kiss on his lips .  Kagero moved moved to his right side as Camilla lowered down to his left , gazing in surprise at the size of Mark's manhood that Kagero had been tending to .  Mark gripped the edge of his bed , his eyes growing hazy and his face growing as hot as the sun as he watched Camilla and Kagero shove his throbbing hard on in between her breasts that they held tightly around it .  Kagero blushed and smiled as she looked up into Mark's whining face ; she found it very cute how he was acting since he had clearly never done anything with a woman before .  Camilla began to squish and thrust his hot throbbing length between her voluptuous breasts while Kagero lovingly sucked on the head of his member .  Mark could no longer hold on to his modesty , gently pressing down on Kagero's head to force her lustful furnace of a mouth down his prick . \
  "  A-AH\'85this is incredible\'85  "   Mark cried out , his hand now clenching onto Kagero's hair as he moved her up and down as they smothered his length with their breasts .  Camilla couldn't help but giggle smooshing her breasts around his moist cock over and over making it twitch and throb while he whined like a helpless puppy .  Mark forced his hand off of Kagero's head in a fit of guilt , eyes staring as she continued on just as he had made her .  The lusty prison in which Mark found his member sent a shock of pleasure up his spine , falling back on his forearms and cried out .  The two beauties felt his body stiffen up as his warm , thick juices shot into the confines of Kagero's mouth .  With every load released , Mark would twitch and yelp , giving Camilla an idea of how much he was truly releasing .  Camilla and Kagero removed their breasts off of his member , stroking it to help him finish .  Slowly , Kagero removed her clenched lips from his head , slowly swallowing down every drop of his cum . \
  "  So , who was bigger dear ?  "   Camilla grinned up at Mark as Kagero pinch her eyes closed , doing her best to swallow down his seed to the best of her abilities . \
  "  I-I couldn't tell to be honest\'85they were both so sizeable\'85I promise I'm not saying that to get more um\'85pleasure , I'm being honest\'85  "   Mark said with a groan , his eyes and face still lit of flame .  Kagero finally gulped the rest of his nectar down , causing a little cough to leave her throat . \
  "  Its\'85bitter\'85  "   Kagero said as she made a quick face of disgust with the final swallow .  The look in Mark's eyes showed that he felt incredibly sorry for something that he clearly didn't need to feel about , causing Kagero to shake her head and smile . \
  "  I'm so sorry Kagero I didn't\'85  "   Mark tried to say but was hushed by her fingers being forced against his lips as she stood . \
  "  There's no reason to feel bad about it Mark , if you do , that will ruin the good experiences you are having .  Just like Camilla said , relax OK ?  "   Kagero said , moving up to plant a kiss on his cheek .  Mark's lips curled into a smile as Kagero pushed him onto the bed gently while Camilla gave a stretch from being on her knees awhile .  Camilla then grinned as she reached up and grasped a hold of Kagero's breasts , causing her to stiffen up in surprise . \
  "  My word , I think Mark was right ; we are the same size .  That's impressive , especially for a Hoshidan ,  "   Camilla teased as Kagero gasped , Camilla's hands giving them a playful squeeze . \
  "  C-Cut that out that feels weird\'85  "   Kagero yelped , trying to shove Camilla off of her .  Camilla then lowered a hand down between Kagero's legs , dipping a few of her fingers into her moist crevice .  Kagero moaned and clenched her eyes shut , finally able to push Camilla way .  Her eyes looked at Camilla's angrily , her face as red as a strawberry .  Camilla shot her grin before shrugging her shoulders . \
  "  Oh come on , don't be such a prude .  You can't keep that beautiful body of yours all to yourself you know ,  "   Camilla said , sticking out her tongue playfully .  Kagero practically growled at her , baring her teeth in anguish as she covered up her chest with her arm .  Camilla sighed and shook her head as Mark sat up and gently tugged on her free arm . \
  "  Kagero , now it's your turn to relax ,  "   Mark snickered causing Kagero to sigh with discontent before smiling back at him .  Kagero leaned her rear against Mark's anxious dick , the friction from her playful tease causing it to grow hard once more .  As she felt it grow back into its prime , she then got off , causing him to moan and gasp . \
  "  Youthful men are always so anxious ,  "   Camilla snickered .  She then placed her hands on Kagero's shoulders , playfully kissing her on the lips , which made her slowly move back . \
  "  I said stop it Camilla\'85what part of AH !  "   Kagero yelped , her throat tightening up in pain as Camilla forced her back onto Mark , who was gently stroking himself from the display .  He then suddenly felt some movement on to the head of his member , Kagero's back now in plain view .  He then groaned out soundly , finding his length being slowly devoured by Kagero's rear hole , surrounding his prick with strange warmth that caused him to whine with pleasure . \
Kagero's eyes widen and she cried out , a sharp pain shooting through her rear and waist as Camilla finished pushing her onto Mark's sizeable member .  Kagero began to blink rapidly as her heart fluttered , her rear twitching and throbbing around his cock . \
  "  Geh ! You harlot , how dare you !  "   Kagero yelled at Camilla , trying to remove herself but Mark wrapped his arms around her waist , trembling as he desperately held her in place .  Kagero flinched in pain with each throb around his member , her body now tense and shaking in fits of agony . \
  "  L-Let go of me Mark\'85  "   Kagero whined , finding herself powerless against Mark's powerful grasp around her waist .  Camilla backed up , proving that she had further to do with the scenario as she watched them both struggle . \
  "  Don't move .  .  . this feels really good Kagero\'85please , don't move away\'85  "   Mark whimpered , causing her to sigh and try to relax with her stuffed rear still throbbing .  Slowly but surely the pain began to subside , her rear now adjusting to Mark's girth . \
  "  If it really feels that good\'85then OK\'85just , take it slow alright ?  "   Kagero groaned , blushing heavily as Mark gently kissed against the back of her neck .  Even Camilla found herself lightly blushing from the cute display , threading her fingers together .  Mark gently reached beneath Kagero's quivering rear ; using his strength to help Kagero move up , then back down onto it .  She gasped painfully as she fell back on it , gritting her teeth to fight through the pain .  While Kagero was moved up , Camilla gently swiped her fingers into Kagero's crevice , using her moisture to coat Mark's hardened appendage .  Kagero's face was completely flushed as she glared as Camilla uncomfortably . \
  "  Don't look at me like that darling , this will make it feel better , trust me ,  "   Camilla said , sighing at Kagero's stubborn attitude towards her participation .  As she moved back down his sizeable member , she felt it glide down much easier , making her feel a jolt of pleasure instead of pain . \
  "  A-Ah\'85I see\'85s-sorry Camilla\'85  "   Kagero's apology made Camilla smile deviously ; she moved towards Kagero as she moved up then slammed back down on his member , causing them both to tremble and groan lovingly .  Kagero gasped and clenched her eyes shut shamefully as Camilla moved to her knees and stuffed Kagero's snatch with her tongue playfully .  Camilla's lips and tongue lovingly probed into Kagero's crotch ; Camilla couldn't help but to pleasure herself while causing Kagero to cry out lustfully along with her rough movements on Mark's length .  Kagero's ass began to grow numb as the overwhelming carnal lust of both of her holes being pleasured made her completely lose her composure .  Kagero's vision went hazy as she found herself staring at Mark's ceiling , her mouth opened wide and panting helplessly ; her arms were wrapped tightly behind Mark's neck , his hands now grasping and messaging her chest while Camilla slid several fingers into her moist crevice , her lips now assaulting her clitoris ruthlessly . \
  "  N-No more\'85no more\'85I-I can't take anymore !  "   Kagero clenched her eyes shut as she began to scream , her body stiffening up and trembling violently .  Her grasp around Mark's neck forced his chin to rest over her shoulder , moaning out as her legs wrapped around Camilla ; her entire body felt shocked as she came to a hard climax .  She grit her teeth and continued to whine as the other two continued , doing their best to reach that point as well .  Kagero's rear began to clench Mark's crotch , strangling it as he tried to keep moving .  He began to grown loudly as he moved his hands to her side , forcing him to use his strength once more to move her . \
  "  K-KAGERO\'85I-I'M\'85 !  "   Mark cried into her back , kissing against her back affectionately as thick loads of his seed began pouring into her ass .  The both of them stopped dead , trembling vigorously as he filled her ass and Camilla finished licking away all of her juices .  Their groans turned into heavy breathing as they both came to their sense , Mark now loving hugging her around her waist .  Kagero's body grew limp as all of her sense became exhausted ; she managed to meet eyes with Mark , kissing his lips lazily as they smiled at one another . \
  "  That felt\'85surprisingly amazing\'85  "   Kagero sigh as she made grunts of pain while moving off of Mark's raw member ; trails of his ejaculate oozed from her rear , coating his length with his own juices as she finally moved off of him .  Kagero laid on his bad , resting his upper body on her stomach as they regained their breath . \
  "  I'm not letting you off that easy Mr .  Artist .  I'm still not satisfied ,  "   Camilla snickered licking her lips ; moving down to suck on his throbbing , tired member .  She cleaned it off from top to bottom with her lips and tongue , causing it to twitch and grow as Mark's voice accompanied it with whines from over exertion . \
  "  I can't take anymore\'85if you keep me going\'85I'm going to break\'85  "   Mark groaned as he tried to keep his eyes focused on Kagero's flustered , smiling face while being pleasured .  Camilla climbed up on top of Mark , cupping his poor , sensitive member with her incredibly hot , moist cunt .  It felt like a furnace against his manhood , causing him to grip his sheets tightly .  Camilla slid her nether region along his member , coating it with her thick juices to make it slide with moist and sticky sounds that started to push him further towards another climax .  Camilla moans and gasps grew , anxiously grounding on his thick curve , leaning forward to seize his lifeless lips passionately .  He began to pant and whine with Camilla , his eyes still trying to look into Kagero's eyes , their glimmer filled will apologies .  Mark reached behind Camilla , digging his fingers into her succulent rear to help her finish quicker , its stabbing causing her to moan out loudly against his lips . \
  "  I can feel you twitching .  .  . and such a cute face you have right now , you want to let it all out don't you ?  "   Camilla moaned , gripping onto his shoulder for leverage .  With his member began to twitch and throb as Mark's voice left him , desperately wanting to cry out in pleasure as Camilla forced her lips to his crying out passionate into his mouth as she climaxed .  She continued to grind on Mark's tortured manhood as her juices soaked it , forcing another thick load to shoot from its head , covering Mark's stomach .  Camilla cupped his checks , finishing their passionate kiss with her tongue parting his .  He began to pant loudly , his body twitching occasionally from the second orgasm that was squeezed from his system .  Camilla sighed contently as she removed herself off of Mark , licking up his cum that splattered onto his stomach . \
  "  Mmm\'85so good\'85I believe Kagero won this time .  I guess you two were just made for each other weren't you ? Hehe , you two look so adorable all sprawled out and exhausted \'85  "   Camilla said , picking her robe off the ground and re-equipping it back onto her frame .  She then smiled and walked over to Kagero , whose face was still completely flushed and covered in sweat . \
  "  He's all yours , just as promised ,  "   Camilla gave her a supportive wink , using her sleeve to dab off the sweat on her brow .  She sighed contently then smiled back . \
  "  Thank you\'85I'm not very good at admitting feelings and this may have been way too much\'85but , thanks for helping me show him how I feel ,  "   Kagero's pseudo serious , appreciative expressive rang true as Camilla gave her an affirmative nod , leaving the two of them to themselves .  As the door shut behind her , Camilla sighed contently , looking down the dark halls that now accompanied her . \
  "  Another happy couple has taken flight .  I think I'm starting to enjoy being a match maker ,  "   Camilla giggled , resting her hands at her sides as she made her way back to her own quarters . \
  "  Alright ! Another successful defensive battle .  .  . man that was tough ,  "   Tobin groan , popping his neck and giving a stretch as the platoon of 4 rested just outside of the barracks walls .  Tobin decided he would plop down next to his buddy Gray while the other two members were talking about what was next .  Tobin noticed Gray's eyes constantly peeping over at more mature and valiant woman named Titania .  He only seen her in battle a few times , but physcially , his curiosity of rather aroused . \
  "  Jeeze Gray , don't you ever have anything else on your mind ?  "   Tobin said giving Gray a small jab in the side to gain his attention .  Gray flinched for a moment then turned to Tobin , rolling his eyes with a groan . \
  "  Of course I do , but man .  .  . just look at her .  That Titania is all woman , you know what I mean ?  "   Gray said with a smirk , knowing well that Tobin wouldn't catch his drift , like always .  He continued to watch as she and Ike talked out their next plan of action when they were to be placed on the front lines once more .  While he chatted , Titania was lovingly grooming her steede , tending do its roughed up wouldnts as well as brushing it down .  As Ike began to walk back towards the exit , Gray immediately jumped up to his feet , his attention now completely fixated on her . \
  "  You honestly think you stand a chance with a woman like that ? You must be delusional or something , there's not a beautiful woman like that would even consider a runt like you ,  "   Tobin smirked rest his head back into his hands . \
  "  Hey you never know til you ask , as they say : No guts , no glory .  And who are you calling a run ? I would ask you to wish me luck , but I don't think I'll need it ,  "   Gray snickered as he made his approach on the busy beauty .  Tobin simply shook his head as he began to rest on the lush , grassy field .  As confidant as Gray was , when it came to approaching a REAL woman , he would get his shakes and jitters just like the rest .  Titania could be heard softly humming as she began to brush her mount's tail , taking care to be gentle and efficient as a small gust came by .  Gray made a nervous gulp and shook his arms , trying to steady his nerves as he finally arrived to the beauty's position . \
  "  You were pretty damn amazing out there Titania , you really know how to weild an axe !  "   Gray smirked , catching her attention as she finished grooming her mount . \
  "  Oh , that was nothing .  Back home things were much tougher to deal with than just some petty soldiers , but thank you for the compliment ,  "   Titania had such a sincere smile to could easily melt Gray's heart like a school boy .  He sighed quietly as he continued gazing into her gorgeous green eyes , which were now examining him carefully . \
  "  You surprised me as well Gray , I thought you were merely just a farm boy , but you handled yourself in that battle like a veteran .  Tell me , where did you learn to fight like that ?  "   Titania inquired .  Gray but on his confident smile and his   "  I'm a big deal  "   eyes as he continued his move on her . \
  "  Much like you that was nothing .  I taught myself how to fight actually , well , with a little help from my friend Alm ,  "   Gray said , crossing his arms with confidence .  Titania couldn't help but to let out a slight laugh as she finally turned her full attention to him . \
  "  You have an interesting look in your eyes .  .  . something tells me you didn't come over here just compliment on my fighting capabilities .  Is there something you need ?  "   Titania couldn't help but to smile as she watch the boy attempting to be a man , which was clearly an attempt to impress her .  Gray found his opening , it was time to make his move . \
  "  Actually yes , I do .  I actually came over here because I couldn't keep my eyes off you during the battle .  You are hands down one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen , and I have seen quick a few ladies in my time ,  "   Gray said with a grin , getting a warm smile in response . \
  "  Well , I never expected a boy like you to be such a charmer .  You're just full of surprises aren't you ?  "   Titania let out a laugh as she approached him .  Gray didn't realize it from a far , but she was actually quite tall and stout for a woman .  With her armor on , she easily bested Gray's height by a few inches .  He shook his nerves by whipping his arms at his side , smiling up at her . \
  "  There's plenty more where that came from .  Tell me something , are you uh .  .  . seeing anyone right now ?  "   Gray tripped over his words for a moment , his heart now racing in his chest .  Titania could clearly see his legs shaking just the slightest with his dark skin brandishing a blush upon his face .  Titania's eyes grew more aggressive as Gray appeared more meek , shaking his nerves again as he gazed at her with confidence once again . \
  "  My word , you are quite the rouge , aren't you Gray ? I'm flattered to hear such boldness over an old woman like me from someone as young as you , but you do realize that your almost young enough to be my son don't you ?  "   Titania softly giggled as she put her front up to test Gray's nerves , her attraction to younger men beginning flourish .  It had been some time since Titania had shared courtships with anyone , so now was as good a time as any to maybe have a little fun .  Gray put on his smug smile as sweat began sliding down his forehead . \
  "  Good thing I'm not your son because something as trivial as age wouldn't dare keep me away from someone as amazing and alluring as yourself .  What do you say ? How about you and I go somewhere to get to know each other a little better , maybe getting some food at the mess hall perhaps ?  "   Gray was on the home stretch , his adrenaline pushing his attitude to the max with confidence as she pined over the thought . \
  "  I would quite like that , it's pretty clear that you want to prove to me that you are a man , but .  .  . I think I'd prefer a place a bit more .  .  . secluded .  What say you Gray , do you want to prove you're a man ? Or do you want to eat dinner with me like a boy ?   "   Titania's laugh was like that of a temptress as she rested her fingers on Gray's chin ; tilting his face up to hers to get a better look at him , she couldn't help but to find him at least somewhat attractive .  Her words caused his heart to stop and his dark skin to feel pale with surprise as he word sunk in . \
  "  I uh .  .  . um .  .  . yeah , secluded .  I would definitely like us to be more secluded ,  "   Gray said with a gulp and a red face .  Titania released his chin , raising up his head band to plant a warm , moist kiss against his sweating forhead . \
  "  See you soon then , Gray .  .  . I'll be waiting ,  "   Titania said , returning his headband and rustling his hair before grabbing the reigns of her horse and walking it to the stable .  Gray couldn't help but to give a victorious cheer once she was out of sight , his charms finally working for the first time .  Tobin yawned and gave a stretch as he saw Gray skipping over to him like a guy on cloud nine .  Tobin cocked his eyebrow as he covered his mouth to yawn . \
  "  How did it go ?  "   tobin asked , expecting to hear some form of rejection , however , he was surprised by the warm aura that surrounded Gray as he showed off a toothy smile . \
  "  No guts no glory pal , no gut no glory ,  "   he said with a snicker as he walked towards the barracks .  Tobin couldn't help but to look in disbelief , scratching the back of his head anxiously as he tried to picture the scenario . \
  "  There's gotta be some kind of catch , there's no way Gray would be able to bed a woman like that otherwise ,  "   Tobin said with a smirk , following after him into the barracks .  Gray looked as if he had just discovered the secret to the universe as he went about his afternoon , his smile refusing to leave his lips .  Even in training , he could help but to smile even when confronted by a very confused Alm .  As Alm went to swing at Gray side with his wooden sword , Gray didn't so much as move , eating it with a groan of pain before being knocked onto his back with a lazy kick . \
  "  Gray , where is your head at ? If you end of fighting like this you'll be dead ,  "   Alm shook his head as he offered his hand out to Gray , who took it graciously . \
  "  Oh don't mind me Alm , I've got some .  .  . initimate business to attend to here shortly ,  "   Gray said , his smug grin refusing to fade .  Alm couldn't help but take training seriously considering he was considered a lord among the members of the barracks .  Alm groaned , wacking Gray on the head with his wooden sword to try and bring his senses back to him .  Gray yelped and rubbed his head , still smiling at Alm . \
  "  Focus !  "   Alm shouted .  Gray shrugged and went about the training regemin , running from the training grounds the moment they were finished .  Gray immediately began searching the massive barracks for Titania's room , being told it was in the west wing . \
  "  This place is so big .  .  . I don't know how anyone finds where they are going .  .  . oh hey I see Ike , he probably knows where she is .  HEY ! IKE !  "   Gray shouted , immediately catching the valiant warrior's attention .  He immediately turned , jogging to him as if it were a genuine emergency . \
  "  Gray what's wrong ? Is everything alright ?  "   Ike inquired .  Gray forgot how over the top cautious Ike could be , which blew up in his face in an instant .  Gray waved his hand in front of his face while he shook it . \
  "  Oh no no , there's no emergency or nothing .  I was wondering if you knew where Titania's room is .  She told me to come see her around this time for something ,  "   Gray said , giving Ike a smirk .  He had seen this sort of ploy before , which only ended with someone being thrown out into the cold with no clothes on . \
  "  You sure you wanna do that ? Titania can be pretty rough .  But if you're that brave , her room is right over there ,  "   Ike pointed , giving Gray a strange surge of fright .  Ike's speech pattern was always so stalwart and noble , so hearing his voice drop the facade was rather eerie .  Gray shrugged it off as he put on his signature smile as he walked past him . \
  "  Don't worry , I can handle anything .  Thanks bud !  "   Gray shouted as Ike walked away shaking his head .  The closer Gray grew to her door , the more nervous he became .  Even though he was quite the charmer , he hadn't really done anything with any ladies , much less things of an intimate nature . \
  "  I hope size doesn't matter .  .  .   "   Gray groaned as he reached her door , refering to his lower appendage that was hoping to see some action .  With a few knocks on the door , a soft   "  come in  "   made its way through the door .  Gray opened the door to see a very interesting sight .  The room had several candles lit , providing a warm light .  Her room was quite neat and tidy with her armor on the upper half of a rack , leading Gray's eyes towards her bed .  Titania smiled at him ; she was covered in a nice , red silk robe with her hair let loose down her back .  Her wavey locks crawled down her back , resting just above her rear .  Gray could help but to take a nervous gulp to try and fight back his nerves . \
  "  Welcome , Gray .  Here , have a seat right here ,  "   Titania said with a smile , patting the spot of her bed next to her .  Gray put up a grin and a nod , slipping off his vest so that he was just in his shirt .  He plopped down next to her , his face growing warm as her heavenly scent hit his nostrils ; it was the smell of roses and honeysuckles .  He quickly noticed that he was actually shorter than her by a few inches , which left him a little embarassed .  Titania turned to him , removing his head band and tossing it to the floor to see his full face .  Titania caressed his cheeks lovingly , brushing the bangs of his hair with her fingers as she analyzed him . \
  "  Your eyes compliment you well .  I must say you are much more handsome up close .  Now , I want you to stay right here and shut your eyes , OK ?  "   Titania ordered with Gray immediately following them .  His heart began to beat in his throat as he felt his skin go clammy from nerves .  He took a deep breath , gripping onto her sheets as he awaited whatever suprise that Titania had in store for him .  He flinched however as the feeling of a cloth was placed over his eyes , tightening up behind his head . \
  "  Um .  .  . what's the blindfold for ?  "   Gray asked , opening his eyes to the sight of darkness .  Titania simply let out a seductive chuckle , planting a soft kiss on his forehead . \
  "  I'd like to play a little game first , if that's alright ,  "   Titania said , running her hands through Gray's hair as his eyes stayed blind .  He trembled a bit with anticipation as he gripped onto her sheets tighter . \
  "  What kind of game ?  "   Gray asked , now feeling that Titania had moved away from him .  He then felt his arms being jerked behind his back , the feeling of some sort of cool metal restraints being clasped around his wrists firmly .  Gray felt a wave of panic shoot through his system but balled his hands into fists to fight it off .  After released , Titania laughed softly as she moved her lips to his ear . \
  "  All you have to do , is do exactly as I say .  If you follow the rules , you'll get rewards , however , if you end of breaking the rules , you'll be punished .  If you get punished 3 times , I'm kicking you out .  And I assure you Gray .  .  . this isn't a kid's game ,  "   Titania said , nipping at Gray's earlobe before moving away .  Gray's body began to tremble as it heated up , his adrenaline now racing through his vains from his pounding heart .  He actually found the feeling of being in the dark rather exciting as he waited anxiously for her first order . \
  "  Sit still , don't make a sound , and don't move an inch ,  "   Titania said .  Gray gave a nod , flinching as he found the top of his shirt being gripped tightly .  The shredding sounds of fabric tearing filled Gray's ears as he felt his chest being exposed to the open air .  Titania then ran her hands over his chest , giving his tightened muscles gently squeezes to ease his tension . \
  "  You're built quite stout aren't you ? I would've never guessed just from looking at you ,  "   Titania smiled and pushed Gray onto his back , which pinched his arms harshly to his back .  The sudden feeling of moist , warm lips began to travel all around his chest and stomach , his hairs standing on edge and his legs shaking as if he were in a blizzard .  He blushed heavily as he bit his lower lips , trying not to make a sound as her hands graced over his now fully erect member .  He wanted to say something about it in his defense , but he instead held his tongue as she dragged his bottoms down to his ankles .  He turned his blinded eyes to the side , blushing from embarassment his member joined his chest in the open air . \
  "  Hehe .  .  . your growth down here is just as cute as you are .  You are much more of a boy here , that's for sure ,  "   Titania giggled , killing Gray's morale deep in his heart .  He had heard that a man's manship is often measured by his growth , so in this instant , he certainly felt defeated . \
  "  Don't worry Gray , I don't believe a man should be measured by the size of his genitals , in fact I find that whole philosophy to be proposturous .  So relax OK ?  "   Titania's kind words put Gray at ease as her hand began rubbing against his curve , causing him to tense of in surprise .  It wasn't long before Gray's face went completely red , panting soundly as he took in the pleasure . \
  "  D-Don't stop .  .  . that feels good .  .  .   "   Gray whimpered and moved his hips into her hand , which immediately caused Titania to back away .  Gray trembled with frustration as Titania sighed softly to his front . \
  "  No no Gray , I said not to make a sound and not to move .  My goodness , if you keep on like that this will be over before we know it .  Now , its time for your punishment ,  "   Titania snickered , grabbing a hold of Gray's arms .  She then dragged him onto the cool , stone floor , putting his chest to the ground to hunch him over .  Gray didn't know how to react , causing him to wave his head around to try and see what was going on , which obviously wasn't working .  He then smelt something rather pleasant ; it smelt of rose pedals and honeysuckles , which were some of his favorite fragrances in spring .  He then flinched as he felt the strange gracing of the side of a foot , caressing his cheek , leaving him confused beyond comprehension . \
  "  I would like you pleasure my feet for me ; it was quite a long battle today and they could use some attention ,  "   Titania couldn't help but to laugh at poor Gray who was now looking up at her still in the dark . \
  "  How am I supposed to do that without my hands ?  "   Gray sighed , prompting for Titania to rest the surface of her toes up under his chin . \
  "  How would you pleasure a woman normally Gray ?  "   Titania's voice remained kind , but was showing signs of impatience as Gray puzzled the question in his mind .  After a minute , a light bulb went off in his mind . \
  "  Alright , I got this !  "   Gray said with enthusiasm as Titania lowered his chin back to the ground .  Gray took a deep breath , sighing slowly as he leaned and pressed his lips to her large toe , cause her to giggle affirmatively .  Gray smiled wide as he kissed along each toe , gently breathing warm air over them after each press .  He then smelt something a bit more odious , realizing that the arch of her foot was in front of his face .  He decided to try a different approach , gulping nervously before slipping his tongue over his bottom lip , now dragging it up into her arm affectionately . \
  "  What the .  .  . why is this turning me on ?  "   Gray puzzled but shrugged off the thought as he continued , once the bottom of her foot was coated in his saliva , Titania moved her foot away with the rustling of her hand going through his hair complimenting his achievement . \
  "  Very good Gray , that was quite pleseant .  I want you to move yourself into a sitting position for me so I can properly treat you ,  "   Titania smiled , giving Gray's face a gentle pat on his cheek before allowing him to move into position .  Once he finally found his way onto his rear , Titania noticed that Gray's manship was incredibly erect , anxiously throbbing without question . \
  "  My word , it seems that my penalty wasn't much of a punishment after all .  You are certainly the odd one Gray .  Now , sit back and relax ,  "   Titania whispered , gently placing her now warm , moist foot onto the curve of his member .  Gray immediately began to tremble , letting out a groan as she slipped his girth between her big toe and second toe .  Titania giggled as she stroked Gray member with her foot , causing him to pant and whine gently after a bit .  Gray couldn't help but to move his hips with her movements , uncaring as to if it were to be punished or not . \
  "  You're so cute Gray , I enjoy watching your face while you are being pleasured ,  "   She said with a smirk as Gray became her helpless toy .  His breathing grew heavier and his trembling growing more violent as she moved quicker ; the slick , sticky sounds of her foot job made Gray crazy , which rather perplexed him considering he never would've imagined doing something like this , much less it feeling so good . \
  "  I .  .  . ah , ah .  .  .  !  "   Gray gasped loudly before clenching his teeth together .  His body immediately tensed up as stiff as a board as he let out a loud groan .  His poor throbbing , twitching member couldn't take anymore , shooting a few loads of his seed all over his stomach and her foot .  She continued to stroke it until she felt it go down , laughing playfully as she moved her foot away .  She smiled and hummed joyfully as Gray let out loud pants from his mouth , a testament to his unusual treat . \
  "  Mm .  .  . how was that Gray ?  "   Titania said , her voice riddled with sexual intent .  Gray finally pulled it together , putting on his signature smile as he moved his blind eyes in her direction . \
  "  That was incredible , I never knew something so strange could feel so good to be honest .  But um , do you think we could clean this off of me ? It feels really gross ,  "   Gray said , his face still shining red with his grin .  Titania smirked as she decided to accomodate his request  , helping Gray onto the edge of her bed for a moment .  He gripped his hand tightly against one another in surprise as he felt her tongue grace his toned stomach , soft moans chasing each lap of her tongue .  Gray shivered and moaned as well as she cleaned up his member as well , softly making a playful swallow as she moved away . \
  "  Better ?  "   Titania said , causing Gray to give an affirmative nod .  Gray heard the sounds of clothing poofing against the floor as he took a heavy sigh of relief .  Titania then moved him back onto the ground , this time placing him on his knees as she turned him to face the bed . \
  "  Alright , what's next ?  "   Gray asked cheerfully , sporting an smile that Titania could only describe as adorable .  She let out another seductive snicker as she gently gripped the back of Gray's head , she tilted his face up for a moment to place an affectionate kiss on his lips .  She removed her mouth from his , forcing his lips up against incredibly warm and moist .  Gray couldn't help but to take a whiff of his new surroundings , causing his whole body to burn up like the sun . \
  "  I-Is this her .  .  .  !  "   Gray thought to himself as he nuzzled into the strange scent and moisture that intoxicated him . \
  "  I hope you can hold your breath well , because this is going to get a little .  .  . rough ,  "   Titania chuckled softly as she gripped a hold of Gray's hair , forcing his lips to smoosh up into her soaked womanhood .  His conciousness grew hazy as he stuck out his tongue , the juices of her moist cunt beginning to make him go crazy .  There were no words to be said as she ground her snatch harshly against his mouth , only moan and chokes coming from Gray's throat .  This time Titania's voice was quite audible , filling his ears with moans and gasps as he helplessly dug his tongue deep inside her .  She laughed with pleasure as he whipered and whined like a puppy , now moving his head on his own accord as she ground his lips to dust . \
  "  I-I can't breathe .  .  .   "   Gray whimpered into her crevice , only turning into vibrating mumbles that made her grab his hair much harder .  Titania's gruff , mature voice began to grunt and groan loudly , both her hands now gripping onto Gray's hair as her muff caused Gray to choke and sway .  She suddenly let out a controlled yell as she trembled wildly , a strange moisture sloshing against his lips and into his mouth .  Gray gulped down the strange substance , trying to keep it from choking him further as he felt his body going limp .  Just as Gray was about to give out , Titania removed his face from between her legs , allowing him to cough and desperately gasp for hair in the aftermath . \
  "  Mmm .  .  . very good Gray .  .  . your lips felt quite wonderful between my thighs .  If I didn't know any better I'd say you've done this before ,  "   Titania giggled at Gray , whose tongue was now sprawled out from his lips as he took heavy breaths to pull himself together . \
  "  Heh .  .  . I .  .  . ugh .  .  . thank you .  I'm glad .  .  . I could .  .  . pleasure you well .  .  .   "   Gray coughed between breaths , causing Titania to wipe his lips with the back of her hand , replacing it with her lips .  The kiss was quite deep , her own gentle panting mixed with his as he continued to gasp for air .  She gently ran the top of her foot up his freshly erect curve causing him to let out a gruff groan . \
  "  Stand up Gray .  I'm going to try something a little .  .  . different on you ,  "   Titania smirked , grasping the side of Gray's arms to help him up .  He nearly toppled to the ground from dizziness , but Titania caught him then turned him so that he was hunched over the bed .  He looked back with grand embarassment in his face , realizing that his rear was now hunched up in front of her with his erect member showing itself . \
  "  What do you plan to do to me now ? This position is kind of strange .  .  .   "   Gray whined , causing Titania to smack his bottom .  He made a grunt of pain , before quieting himself , allowing Titania to speak . \
  "  Hehe .  .  . just be a good boy and stay quiet ,  "   Titania teased as she turned away .  Gray stared at the wall in front of him , trying to calm his nerves and his now stinging rear as Titania moved away . \
  "  Why do I get the feeling that this is going to hurt ?  "   Gray whispered quietly as Titania's steps began to return towards him .  Gray flinched and tensed up as a strange , cool liquid substance began to be smothered all over his rear whole , his rear trying to clench against Titania firm hold . \
  "  What is that ? ! It's really cold ,  "   Gray groaned , a playful snark sound came from her lips as she gently forced a finger into his rear .  Gray tried to tense up again , but Titania's strength kept him still . \
  "  Just relax Gray , it's an ointment .  Trust me , you'll be glad I used it here in a moment ,  "   Titania said , reaching forward to give Gray's shoulder an affectionate squeeze .  Gray made a hefty sigh as she finished , leaving him with a very uncomfortable , cold moisture that made him feel rather uncomfortable .  Suddenly , he flinched and tensed up like steel as a foreign object began to be inserted into his rear . \
  "  W-Wait wait wait , what is that ? ! It kind hurts !  "   Gray yelped , his cries being ignored with a soft fit of laughter and long cylindrical object being completely stuffed inside of his rear .  He grit it teeth tightly as he bit the sheets with his teeth . \
  "  Trust me Gray , if I hadn't used the ointment this would be agonizing .  I promise it will feel good shortly .  Just calm your body and it will grow used to the feeling ,  "   Titania said , hunching forward to give Gray a soft kiss on his cheek .  Gray sighed , remembering Ike's words from earlier as his rear hole twitched and throbbed . \
  "  Grr freakin' Ike .  .  . a-alright Titania , I feel a bit better now , thank you ,  "   Gray said , clenching his teeth tightly as he forced a smile .  Titania smiled , this time giving his rear a little squeeze . \
  "  That's the attitude I wanted to see , good boy ,  "   Titania giggled as she gently grasped the base of Gray's surprisingly erect length .  Gray knew it was too late to stop now , especially considering how much confidence he had been showing off this whole time .  Gray took a deep breath as he felt the object being moved out slowly , her hand stroking him carefully with it .  Gray felt a moment of relief before feeling it being pushed back in , his grunts resurfacing .  Gray's confusion resurfaced as he grew used to the odd , painful sensation ; his member felt incredibly stimulated , as if he were forcibly being pushed into being aroused as she continued to pump his member firmly . \
  "  This feels really , really weird .  .  . but , kind of good .  .  .   "   Gray whined , her movements growing stronger and quicker by the minute .  It wasn't long before Gray's throat clenched up , forcing out a silent , whispy cry as he came .  The sensation of his orgasm was more tense than Gray had ever felt before , leaving him to feel a bit ashamed of himself .  Titania made sure to catch his nectar in her other hand so not to make a mess of her floor .  Gray continued to pant loudly with hints of pain scattered through out as Titania slowly slide out the object from his rear .  With a final tug , it was finally removed from his rear , causing him to cry out in pain as he clenched his teeth .  Taking a moment to reflect , he came to the realization that it actually wasn't all that bad . \
  "  Are you OK Gray ?  "   Titania asked in concern as his rear hole throbbed and twitched .  Gray forced out his smile as he panted from the pain , turning back to her the best he could . \
  "  That .  .  . was really weird , but I won't lie .  .  . it did feel pretty good in the end ,  "   Gray's voice lightened up with a heavy sigh and a nervous chuckle that made Titania smile in approvement . \
  "  I'm very glad Gray .  It seems you're certainly more of a man than I had anticipated ,  "   Titania leaned forward , tugging at his painful , throbbing wrists that had fought against the tight retraints so violently before .  His eyes lit up with surprise as he felt the retraints tighten , then removed from his wrists like being freed from a prison .  He made a painful , yet victorious grunt as she turned him around and shoved him onto his back .  He felt Titania , warm , supple body press against his , strattling him as she removed the blindfold .  Gray's eyes were quite hazy , barely able to stay open as the red haired beauty looked him dead in the eyes . \
  "  You passed the test my dear Gray , you have proven that you are man enough to have me as your own .  Congratulations ,  "   Titania whispered , kissing Gray's panting lips deeply .  Gray felt like his body weighed a ton as he slowly moved his shaky arms up and drooped them behind her neck , returning the passionate kiss with gusto .  Their tongues hung for a moment as their lips parted , both of them smiling lovingly into one anothers eyes . \
  "  Heh .  .  . heh .  .  . th-that was easy .  .  . wait .  .  . as your own ?  "   Gray's words wavered with his twitching , exhausted frame that was now warming beneath her .  Titania couldn't help but to chuckle as she caressed his face , her eyes lovingly examining his . \
  "  I really do like you Gray , even if I hadn't put you through that test of sorts .  You are very brave , recklessly so at time .  You always look out for your comrades on the battlefield , even if you are at risk .  And , hehe , you have impecable taste in women ,  "   Titania and Gray both shared a laugh as she leaned forward to hug around his neck as well . \
  "  Just doin what I'm supposed to is all .  And especially in this moment , its definitely all well worth it ,  "   Gray chuckled this time kissing Titania first .  With Titania's snatch cupping Gray's member , he felt himself able to go at her one last time as it grew to full size .  As much as it ached from all the stimulation , he wasn't about to let a little exhaustion steal his earnings . \
  "  Hehe , this is one of the best things about you also being young you know .  Young boys are always full of such .  .  . stamina ,  "   Titania blushed lightly , her succulant , pale body now pressing to his as she playfully rocked on his length , teasing it as Gray struggled to move beneath her . \
  "  At least you know I'm a man too , but .  .  . I won't lie .  .  . this is kinda of my first time so .  .  . don't be too judgey or nothin OK ?  "   Gray said with nervous eyes , causing Titania to brush his short bangs away from his forehead . \
  "  You're right Gray , because until you've made love with an experienced woman , you've never done it right ,  "   Titania laughed lovingly as she seized Gray's lips , lifting her rear up and reaching down to position is length carefully .  Gray heart pounded vigorously against hers , his rear still aching like hell as she slowly moved it inside of her .  As much as his body ached , the very moment she had taken his whole member in , he felt a surge of love and passion that easily overode any pain .  Gray continued to keep his lips locked with hers as he ran his firm hands down her back , stretching out to grasp onto Titania's shapely rear with a rough squeeze .  She let out loud gasp against his lips , smiling as she used the strength of her legs to slowly ride on his manhood . \
  "  This .  .  . is .  .  . awesome !  "   Gray thought to himself , using what strength he had left in his arms to assist her movement on top of him .  His member was twitching and throbbing with anxiousness , his sensitivity reaching its brink unexpectedly .  He began to panic , too lost in his lust and to weak to move her off of him . \
  "  T-Titania slow down ! I'm already going to .  .  .   "   Gray's words were silenced by Titania's aggressive lips , her tongue drowning his words out as he throbbed wildly inside of her .  Titania smirked as Gray tensed , yelling loudly into her mouth as his seed began to pour within her insides .  Titania snickered seductively , refusing to stop as he finished expelling inside of her .  She released his lips , watching as he began to whine out loudly , eyeing her apologetically . \
  "  I-I'm sorry I ca .  .  .   "   Gray with silenced by two of Titania fingers pressing to his lips , her hips stopping for a moment so that he could breathe . \
  "  Shh .  .  . don't worry about it .  Let's keep going , OK ?  "   Titania smiled , melting Gray's anxieties and nerves away . \
  "  If you say so .  .  . but I don't wanna you know , get you .  .  .   "   Gray groaned as he was hushed a third time . \
  "  You'll be a real man and take responsibility won't you Gray ?  "   Titania couldn't help but to grin as she brushed off some sweat from Gray's brow .  Gray couldn't believe his ears as she smiled in his eyes .  He gently grasped behind Titania's head , slowly lowering her face to his . \
  "  I'll be all the man you can handle Titania ,  "   Gray said with a chuckle as he felt his strength start to leave him .  His eyes fluttered as Titania began to move on him once more , sloshing his seed around inside of her which made Gray's manship come alive once more .  His moans and whines became helpless and wild as Titania had her way with him , smile and giggling the whole way as she continued swapping saliva with him .  Titania went faster and harder , grasping onto Gray's hair and shoving his face into her bouncing chest .  He let his mouth and tongue hang out , grasping her back and smothering her chest with kisses and lips as she began to tremble . \
  "  Ah .  .  . AH !  "   Titania cried out as she clenched onto him tightly , his hips refusing to stop this time as she climaxed .  Gray couldn't handle much more , crying out and whining into her chest that she clenched him to .  Another warm load of his seed filling her to the brim .  Gray's conciousness wavered for only a moment before leaving him entirely .  Titania sighed contently as she felt Gray's body go limp , releasing his head and lovingly kissing him on the lips . \
  "  Good night sweet man of mine ,  "   Titania said , pulling off of him .  She watched in amazement as his excessive amounts of sperm oozed out of her crevice and onto his sleeping member . \
  "  Hehe , you really are a man aren't you ?  "   Titania reached over , grabbing Gray's shirt and cleaning him off before moving him onto his back .  She then moved up behind him , wrapping her well toned arms around his stomach and chest before kissing him softly on his neck . \
The next morning , Tobin found himself in the mess hall , chatting with Alm , Kliff , and Faye about the battle the day before , and of course , about Gray's attempted escopades . \
  "  For real ? Gray actually tried to make a move on that Titania woman ?  "   Kliff asked , gazing at a sighing Tobin in disbelief . \
  "  Yeah , he even said she agreed to it and that they were going to do stuff last night ,  "   Tobin said as he shook his head , stuffing his mouth full of bread .  Alm simply smiled as Faye eyes him affectionately , hinting that she would like that as well . \
  "  Good for him , Titania is a very strong and beautiful woman .  I hope things turned out well .  Oh there he is now , HEY GRAY .  .  .  !  "   Alm's enthusiasm paused for a moment as he watched poor Gray make his way over .  He was hunched over , limping on his legs as if he were an old man without a cane .  He made a disgruntled wince of pain with every step , as if he had just taken a painful trip to the water closet .  He finally made it to the table , stumbling into the seat next to Tobin with a yelp of pain with his landing . \
  "  Gray are you OK ? What happened to you ? !  "   Tobin asked out of genuine concern .  Gray turned to face Tobin's with a big grin on his face , his eye clenched closed from the pain in his rear . \
  "  Glory hurts , but it's so worth it ,  "   Gray said with a chuckle .  The conversation about his magical night with Titania made the rest of the table lose their appetite , aside from Alm who seemed very happy for him .  Titania smiled as she watched Gray and his friends , crossing her arms as she leaned against a pillar .  Ike caught sight of her , immediately making his way to her side as he noticed her beautiful smile . \
  "  How did it go ?  "   Ike asked , Titania's tired , yet cheerful eyes turning to his . \
  "  Let's just say big things come in small packages ,  "   She chuckled as Ike gave her a pat on the back .    "  Jill ! You're going in too deep , pull back !  "   Ike shouted from the ground as he watched Jill zoom overhead .  During the meeting before the battle , the roles of each individual had been carefully laid out : Ike , Jill and Titania would provoke the enemy out of position so that Alfonse's forces could flank them from the sides .  It was a classic pincer move that had proven successful quite a number of times against Bruno's forces .  However , Jill's mind was full of memories of her father and how grand a wyvern lord he was .  The death of her father still weighed heavily on her heart , often flaring up deep inside of her when she took to the battlefield .  Jill's eyes filled with furious tears as she twirling her poleaxe over her head before locking it into an attacking position . \
  "  I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN DO FATHER ! JUST WATCH ME .  .  . I'LL MAKE YOU PROUD !  "   Jill cried , diving at the firm line of infantry that sat on the top wall of the stronghold .  Ike clenched his teeth as he watched her wreckless act , growling as he watched a flurry of arrows begin to fly about .  Ike raised his blade over his head , now charging the enemy head on with a call out to Titania , who was the vice commander of the operation . \
  "  Titania join me up front ! We're going to have to charge through these forces to get to Jill before they shoot her down !  "   he shouted , Titania's mount now storming at his side .  Several bodies dropped form the sky as Jill swatted them off the their perch , quickly shifting her reigns to make a u-turn on her wyvern .  Ike and Titania began cleaving away at the enemy , dropping soldier after soldier as they desperately tried to make their way on top of the wall .  The number of Bruno's troops began to grow in mass waves , stumping Ike's and Titania's attempt to breach the parameter before they could even gain a foothold in .  Ike groan in aggrevation as he went on guard , his eyes constantly shifting between his foe and Jill to make sure she was still a loft . \
  "  Ike this is too much ! We have to fall back !  "   Titania chimed in , chopping down three soldiers with a powerful wide swing .  Her horse made a war cry as she pulled viciously on the reigns , turning it completely around to make a hasty retreat .  Ike on the other hand refused to be pushed back so easily , cutting down 3 more soldiers with a single stroke of his blade .  His attention was suddenly swayed by the screaming sounds of a wyvern in agony , forcing him to take a roll along the ground .  Guarding the next blow then kicking then giving them a shoulder bash to back off , Ike immediately chased after the sound as he dashed off to escape .  High above he watched as a barrage of arrows sunk their stinging tips into the wyvern's wings , causing Jill to lose control of her altitude . \
  "  No no no ! We can't go down now ! Come on , hang in there !  "   Jill cried , grasping a hold of her beloved wyvern as she pulled hard on her reigns , changing her trajectory of her fall .  Ike chased after the roaring wyvern as it desperately tried to hold up in the sky , but another barrage of arrows finally put down the persistant beast .  Ike's eyes then widened with fear as he watched Jill being thrown from the saddle from 100 feet int he air , now plummeting into the forested area west of the castle . \
  "  DAMN IT ALL ! Titania , join Alfonse's unit and follow his order , I'm going in to forest to try and retrieve Jill !  "   Ike growled , sheathing his sword and running at top speed towards the woods .  Titania sighed and shook her head , immediately turning her mount towards the hill in which Alfonse was perched . \
  "  Your heart is to big for its own good sometimes Ike , but then again , that's why a lot of us follow you ,  "   Titania sighed with a shake of her head .  All of Ike's senses were blinded by his fear and anger ; all that filled his mind was finding Jill and praying to the Gods that she wasn't snuffed from this world .  No matter how small , no matter how long they had been with him , he cared for everyone under his command within the Greil mercenaries as if they were family , and he wasn't about to have one of his siblings die needlessly .  The occasional whines of the dying wyvern acted as his guide as he trounced through the thick brush of the woods , avoiding as many natural obstacles as he could . \
  "  Where is she , where is she .  .  . this damn forest is so thick .  .  . wait .  .  . I think that's her !  "   Ike droned , finally spotting the red armor of his dear soldier and friend .  Although the wyvern was nowhere in sight , the rider was now in plain sight .  He could see several arrows lodged in her side , sticking out in his direction as he finally arrived to her .  He immediately dove into the dirt , quickly examining her . \
  "  Jill ! Jill !  "   Ike cried , giving her a few sudden shakes .  Jill's body began to tremble as she opened up one eye , looking at her savior with tears . \
  "  I-I'm sorry Ike .  .  . I should've just listened .  .  . my side .  .  . really hurts .  .  .   "   Jill frowned with grand guilt in her heart , the pain shooting through her side and back like electricity shocking her system . \
  "  Shh shh it's OK Jill , just save your strength .  We need to get out of the open immediately .  Just .  .  . stay still OK ?  "   Ike muttered , gathering his thoughts and nerves to steady himself as he analyzed the scenario .  He wrapped his arms beneath her back and knees , hoisting her up against his chest so that he could go to try and find somewhere more suitable to rest .  Jill's face was flushed as she turned her pained , teary eyes up to Ike , huddling against him for warmth as blood trailed from her arrow wounds .  Ike paused as the sound of movement began to surround him .  Spinning in slow circles , he tried to take heed to which direction that hailed the loudest .  He then paused as something moist dripped onto his head , now realizing what the sounds were truly signifying . \
  "  Great .  .  . just what we need .  Hang on Jill , I'm going to have to pick up the pace ,  "   Ike sighed , charging through the woods as a wild storm began to form .  Rain began to flood their path , forcing him to now tredge through mud and debris as he searched .  Jill still couldn't believe her eyes as they admired Ike's fierce determination , putting his own life on the line to take care of her .  Finally , a spark of luck finally flashed itself before them ; there was a giant tree whose roots arched from its base , creating a cavity large enough for the both of them to slip into comfortably .  Ike carefully eased into the cavity , with there hardly being enough room to so much as sit up straight .  He let out a sigh as he gently laid her out onto her back , helping her stretch out her limbs so that she could comfortably flat .  He began stripping down her armor piece by piece until it was all laid out to the side .  Ike perked up once he found the arrows locations .  He turned to Jill with apologetic eyes as he gently pressed his hand to her stomach . \
  "  This is going to hurt like hell Jill , but I need to get these arrows out .  Take a deep breath and hold it OK ?  "   Ike sighed with Jill giving him a very weak nod .  He firmly planted his hand onto her stomach , counting off so that she knew when he was to pull .  Finishing his counting , he pulled at the first arrow with all of his might , causing a scream of pain to leave her quivering lips .  He quickly tossed it away , grasping onto the second one with a fierce yank .  Jill's screams echoed for a moment within the cavity before Ike was able to figure out how to mend the wounds . \
Quickly thinking , he immediately whipped his cape around , grunting as he tore a long , thick strip of it off by force .  He then quickly returned his attention to Jill , raising her up so that he could warp it around her small , frail frame .  Jill made dreadful grunts of pain as he tied it up harshly , making sure that it wouldn't come undone in the process .  Breathing heavily with constant whimpers between each , Jill immediately turned her eyes to Ike . \
  "  I-Ike .  .  . I-I'm very cold .  .  .   "   Jill winced , her face growing red while her skin was going pale .  Ike took another dross , heavy sigh , slowly removing the restraints on his own armor as well .  Article by article , he began to blanket Jill in his clothes and cape , creating a makeshift blanket to try and heat her up underneath it .  Ike pressed a hand to his forehead than onto hers , getting a quick read of her temperature while she heated up . \
  "  I-I'm sorry Ike .  .  . I couldn't get my father out of my mind .  .  . I'm trying so hard to get his death out of my feelings but .  .  .   "   Ike placed his fingers against Jill's lips , quieting her as he wiped a small tear from her eyes . \
  "  Just relax OK ? I'm not upset with you or anything over this .  I was just worried to death that you could've gotten yourself killed ,  "   Ike whispered , removing his undershirt and folding it up to form a makeshift pillow for her head . \
  "  You know , you and I aren't so different in that regard .  .  . I still remember the day that my father was killed .  .  . it seemed so unreal that I refused to believe it really happened .  It wasn't til a bit of time went by that I could finally put it behind me enough to function , especially since I had become a leader .  Even though you were a drifter that just happened to join us , I've always thought of you as one of my own .  You are reckless sure , but you do have a good heart , and that's something you shouldn't ever lose sight of ,  "   Ike said , moving a handkerchief from his pocket out into the rain . \
Jill couldn't help but to blush , her eyes fluttering from embarassment as she looked all over Ike's well toned body , studying it as if she were a scholar ; it was clear that he not only took care of everyone else , that he earned his title and leadership with his own strength and nothing more .  She huddled down so that only her eyes were visible as she wrapped herself up in his clothing .  Ike turned and placed the cool , soaked cloth on her forehead , gently giving it a press to make sure it was laid soundly .  The the sharp sound of Ike drawing his blade caught her attention ; she turned to see him resting it against his arm , his gaze now staring outward ; it was clear now that he was on guard .  For hours Jill's eyes stared at Ike ; her heart steadily racing in her chest with her body now shivering from anxiousness .  His kindness , his strength , and his looks ; it was all of these things that ran circles in Jill's mind as she continued to gaze at her savior . \
  "  You know .  .  . if you get tired you can lay next to me ,  "   Jill offereed with a quaint meek tone in her voice .  Ike turned and smile but shook his head all the same . \
  "  I need to keep watch , even if it's all night .  I would love nothing more than to spend a night with someone as pretty as you Jill but you aren't in very good shape to move and we could still be in danger ,  "   Ike sighed , returning his gaze out into the rain .  Jill tried to sit up in her spot but immediately groaned and yelped as a sharp pain tore into her side .  She immediatly laid back down , now twitching and wincing with regret of her hasty decision . \
  "  You think .  .  . I'm pretty ?  "   Jill whispered softly , too shy to ask it aloud .  She didn't expect a reply since she felt her words were drowned out by the roaring rain , but Ike turned around and gazed in to her pained yet kind eyes . \
  "  Anyone who would think otherwise doesn't matter .  You do realize that several of the other women within the group are actually quite jealous of your youth and that dazzling red hair of yours .  The way you fight in battle is very inspiring to a lot of the younger recruits and you have proven time and time again to be a valuable asset .  Sure you lost yourself to your sorrows this battle , but it is because you are human and someone that cares for others with all of their heart .  So yes , you are pretty Jill ,  "   Ike chuckled , gently rubbing her head before turning back out towards the rain .  Jill's heart began to race in her chest , causing all her admirable emotions to shine like the sun .  Her poor hazy eyes stayed on his frame , thoughts of what to do running in her mind . \
  "  I'll never get another chance like this again .  I can't let these wounds stop me .  .  . I have to show Ike how I feel .  .  .   "   Jill groaned attempting to sit up once again .  This time she held her breath , holding back any sounds of pain that she truly felt so that she could make her move .  The rain's downpour grew deafening as she slowly removed her shirt .  It wasn't that she needed to get his attention , but she found it rather uncomfortable underneath all of his removed attire .  She forced her arms and legs into a crawl , slowly moving along to prevent as much pain as possible from her wounds . \
Ike sighed and closed his eyes ; the cool , brisk mist that followed the rain's fall refreshed his body from its exaustion from the battle earlier .  As loud and trampling as the rain was , his ears were quite sharp , picking up on the sound of shifting clothing from behind .  He turned around to see what the stirring was , only to find a pair of arms reaching out and grasping him weakly .  Ike shook his head , helping her maintain her hold so that she didn't fall flat on her face . \
  "  Jill you shouldn't be moving , you'll only make your wounds wor .  .  .   "   Ike sighed , his face turning a bit red as he realized that her naked chest was now smooshed against his back .  She began trembling as she used all of her strength to stay grasped onto him .  Nuzzling against his back , she clearly had gained Ike's attention as his hands ran over hers . \
  "  What are you doing Jill .  .  . if you keep moving like this you'll seriously hurt yourself and the last thing I need is you bleeding all over the place ,  "   Ike said , trying to remain calm and to keep his wits together .  Jill began groaning as her lips grazed his skin at the back of his neck , his hands now pressing down on Jill's hands firmly . \
  "  Ike .  .  . I think I'm in love with you .  .  . I've really liked you for some time now .  Ever since you let me join the mercenaries , you've supported me and helped to make me the person I am now .  I had developed feelings for you ever sense then .  Being like this with you , right now in this moment , I realized that my feelings are more than just liking you .  .  . like you said I'm young , but , I can tell where my heart stands .  Being alone with you like this leads me to believe that now was the time to finally let out my feelings .  So Ike , just know that I love you and would do anything in my power to make you happy ,  "   Jill clenched onto him , her nails nearly digging into his skin as she refused to let go .  Ike grasped a hold of her hands , removing them from his chest .  He laid down his blade upon the ground before turning to her , his full attention gazing into her bright red face .  He ran his thumb along the brim of her eye , catching tears that began to form and shifting them from her face . \
  "  Are you sure its not just because I saved your life ? I'm not doubting you , but you've never really showed off any interest in me since I've known you aside from kind smiles and chipper agreements .  I do like you Jill , I really do , but .  .  . think clearly first before saying things like .  .  .   "   Ike's words were silenced as Jill weakly clung her body onto him , forcibly smooshing her quivering lips to his own .  He paused for a moment , gazing into her teary eyes before curling her up in his arms .  He gently slid his hand up behind her head beneath her flowing red locks , holding her still so that he could properly return her affectionate touch .  Ike slowly moved Jill's trembling frame back down , laying her out as he had before .  He parted his lips from hers , her whole expression displaying itself as helpless as it could be as it took a gaze outside . \
  "  I .  .  . guess there won't be any troops lugging through this awful storm .  .  . so Jill .  .  . I would like to show you how I really feel as well .  I guess it has been ever since we really discussed our lives with one another , how we shared our pain .  It made me realize that I wasn't alone in my suffering .  It wasn't so much that I didn't know others were and felt the same , but with you it felt like an incredibly strong attachment to the matter .  So please , let me show you how you make me feel in return ,  "   Ike's face faintly grew red as he smiled down at her warmly . \
Jill was on cloud nine as she watched her newly beloved move to her legs , gently brushing his hands over them in a messaging motion .  Jill's toes curled with her hands clenching up , the feeling of Ike's strong hands making her lose herself in passion .  She stared in utter disbelief as Ike slowly parted her legs , his lips dabbing up her inner thighs until reaching her freshly moist crotch .  Her eyes grew anxious and desperate , pleading for Ike to continue on as his eyes caught sight of hers .  He let a small smile curl across his mouth before slowly moving his face between her thighs .  Jill let out a loud gasp as something firm and moist dug into her crevice , rubbing and prodding it curiously with its sudden movements . \
  "  A-Ah .  .  .   "   Jill gasped , wincing from both pain and pleasure as Ike mashed his lips into her soaked crevice , moaning softly with every wince of her body .  Jill entangled her fingers into Ike's short , sapphire hair , gently grasping a hold of it as he continued to pleasure her .  He slowly dug his tongue all the way up her slit and against her sensitive pleasure , gently moving one of his sizeable fingers up inside of her . \
  "  Ah .  .  . I-Ike .  .  . don't stop .  .  .   "   Jill whined , wrapping her legs around the back of his head as she began to press down with her firm grasp .  Ike took it all in stride ; he gently swirled his tongue around her clit , shifting over it again and again as he continued to plummet his finger deeper .  Jill sudden cried out loudly , whining and panting soundly as her body tensed up around Ike .  Ike closed his eyes , taking in her taste and scent as she came to a climax .  Slowly , she released her from her deathly grasp , huffing heavily as she laid back and relaxed on the pile of clothes that Ike had shed for her . \
  "  You have a very .  .  . strong odor and taste ,  "   Ike chucked softly , causing her to cover her face in embarassment as he wiped his mouth clean . \
  "  I'm sorry , I'm sorry ! I haven't been taking care of myself too well down there lately .  .  .   "   Jill sighed , curling up into a ball as she winced in pain .  Ike rolled his eyes and shook his , rolling her onto her back once more , removing her hands so that he could kiss her lovingly . \
  "  I didn't say it was unpleseant did I ?  "   Ike smirked at Jill whose face was now as red as her hair .  He then gently kissed her forehead as the rustling sounds of his bottoms slid down his legs .  Jill quickly covered her mouth , her eyes fluttering with her heart as she looked down his body , noticing that he was rather blessed in the masculine department .  Ike snickered , gently tilting her chin up so that her eyes were forced to face his . \
  "  My eyes are up here Jill ,  "   Ike said with a chuckle , causing Jill's eyes to avert from his nervously .  Ike slowly eased forward as he reached down , gently pressing his fingers to the base of his member to guide it .  Jill shivered and gasped as the head of Ike's member gently dipped into her snatch , causing her to tense up slightly . \
  "  Are you sure you want to do this with me Jill ? I won't make a move unless you say its OK ,  "   Ike said with a warm smile , brushing her bangs from her face once more to gaze into her gleaming eyes .  She smiled back cheerfully , wrapping her arms around his neck to pull his lips to hers .  Ike groaned and grunted as he slowly eased his prick inside of her , her outter lips and inner parts forcfully being stretched by his girth .  She shook and cried into Ike's lips in pain , both her side and inside now throbbing . \
  "  Are you alright ? Sorry if I'm a little um .  .  . big .  I hope it doesn't hurt too much ,  "   Ike sighed , stopping his advance .  Jill clenched her teeth but formed a painful smile , pressing her forehead to his as she shook and shivered . \
  "  G-Go ahead .  .  . I-I can handle it .  .  .   "   Jill grunted , her arms tightening around his neck as he slowly stuffed the rest of his sizeable member inside of her .  Ike couldn't help but to gasp out loudly , her walls clenching his member tightly .  Its throbbing from being stretched to far caused Ike to tremble himself , keeping it inside of her until she felt she was OK . \
  "  It's .  .  . kind of a tight fit .  .  . do you need me to pull out ? I can tell its really hurting you ,  "   Ike groaned , resisting the urge to move .  Jill's tense body relaxed a bit , her cool , pale hands cupping his cheeks as she eased up her pained expression . \
  "  N-No , I like you right where you are .  Just .  .  . give me a minute OK ?  "   Jill winced , smiling and winking at him affectionately as he her crevice began to grow accustomed to the feeling .  After a minute or so , Jill kissed him gently on the lips , whispering for him to move . \
He laid his hands out behind her head to cushion it as he made his move .  She gasped and groaned in relief as he slowly eased his manhood out , waiting a moment before slowly stuffing it back in once more .  This time Jill didn't make a grunt of pain ; this time it was a gasp of pleasure . \
  "  Does .  .  . that feel alright ?  "   Ike said with a smile , staying in steady motion as his body began to heat up . \
  "  Yeah .  .  . th-that feels amazing .  .  . please .  .  . give me more .  .  . Ike ,  "   Jill gasped and smiled , playfully licking at his lips .  Ike seized her lips forcefully , continuing to take steady strokes in and out of her .  Her tight , throbbing walls began to drive his senses up the wall , his body aching to tear her apart .  He made a brash thrust into her , his sizeable member forcing her insides to stretch out roughly .  She made a small scream inside of his mouth , her body tensing up and shaking in agony and lust . \
  "  Oh sorry ! Was that too much ?  "   Ike said , but was silenced with her grasping a hold of his head .  She stuffed is face into her breasts as she moved against his thrusts . \
  "  No no , that was a good cry .  I'm ready for whatever you want to do to me .  .  . I'm trusting you with my heart Ike , I know you won't harm me ,  "   Jill said with a loving smile , stroking his hair as he began to kiss against her bare chest .  He began to pick up his pace , grasping onto her tightly to hold her still as her loud cries filled their little cavity .  It was almost unreal ; Jill nor Ike ever imagined of doing something like this out in the open , or at least not indoors .  The sweet smells of the soaked plants and trees made them feel as if there was nothing more right in their lives . \
  "  If you keep clenching me like that I won't be able to hold out much longer .  .  .   "   Ike's muffled voice resonated against Jill's shifting , bare chest .  Ike found himself being forced into licking and sucking against her breasts , his every thrust into her causing her whole body to tremble uncontrollably . \
  "  I-I can't take much more , I'm starting to get dizzy ,  "   Jill yelped wide smile , her eyes half closed and her cries out loud .  Her pants and moans were starting to grow rather feral , which Ike seemed to take a strange fondness to .  In response he lifted up her legs , putting them over his shoulders so that he had no more room of restraint .  His muffled growls turned into yells as he shook and shifted , faster and faster without a stop in sight . \
Ike's gasped for air as Jill let out a scream of pleasure , his face and mouth being smashed into her chest .  Ike resistance finally broke , his member now twitching and throbbing wildly deep inside of her .  He then gave her crevice one more hard slam , digging it iin a deeply as it could go as his yells broke free of soft prison .  He tensed and winced , groaning as load after hot load of his seed flooded Jill's snatch .  His occasional twitches gave Jill a warm smile , a testament of their love had now blossomed .  Ike forced his body up , pinning her down tot he ground and latching his lips onto hers as his nectar filled her to the brim . \
  "  Gods .  .  . Jill .  .  . I .  .  . I love you ,  "   Ike huffed and puffed , catching his breath to match up with his pounding heart .  Jill gives his lips another peck , pulling his well toned body into a passionate hug as their lustful chills began to subside . \
  "  It feels .  .  . really warm .  .  . I think .  .  . I'm going to pass out .  .  .  ,  "   Jill gasped and groaned , clenching around his crotch one last time before he decided to pull out .  The pain , anguish , and pure love that her body she went through wore her system out , her side now bleeding once more .  Ike let out a sigh as he tore another line of fabric from his cape that had been tossed aside .  He gently removed the previous wrap and carefully replaced it , her face showing signs of relief . \
  "  You're tougher than you look ,  "   Ike said with a chuckle as he pulled her into a warm embrace .  He shifted over so that he was near his piles of clothing then pulled it all overtop of them , keeping them nice and warm as the night came to pass .  The sounds of gallops accompanied the next morning , causing Ike to sit up and let loose a vicious yawn .  His eyes turned to the entrance of the cavity , only to see a smirking Titania gazing at the two of them . \
  "  That must've been quite the rescue mission ,  "   She laughed softly , causing Ike's face to turn a faint shade of red .  They both had a laugh about it on their way back to the barracks with Jill sleeping soundly after re-equipping her armor .  That wonderous night would never be forgotten by the two of them , for better or for worse . \
  "  Hmm .  .  . what's this ?  "   Lyn said with a tilt of her head .  Coming back from a skirmish , Lyn was ready to head back into her quarters and dress into something more casual .  However , upon reaching her door she noticed a note ; its font was in very fine caligraphy , there wasn't a single splotch of ink nor were their any signs of editing .  She carefully unpinned it from her door so that she could read the note up close .  It read :\
  "  Lyn , I have grown quite fond of you over these past few months here in Askr .  Of course , my feelings for you were has been longer lived than you may had ever guessed , but that was intentional .  I .  .  . had a dream last night .  A dream where you and I were frolicking through a field of blossoming flowers .  We were laughing and playing , intertwining the flowers and their stems to create crowns of fully bloomed roses as a testament to our friendship .  Silly I know , and it's embarassing to really tell you , but the second part of the dream is what brought me here to leave this note for you . \
After we exchanged our flowery crowns , the whole world around us turned blinding white .  I was forced to see sight of you and I being torn apart .  I watched your body fade out of existance , leaving me all alone in the bright white void .  I fear that this dream is a premenission and not just a nightmare .  Lyn , please meet with me in the west wing hallway .  It's completely quiet at this time of day so its the best spot possible for me to let you truly know my feelings .  I hope to see you soon .  -Florina  "   Lyn softly read to herself . \
  "  A dream .  .  .  ? Her feelings .  .  .  ? This is very strange .  .  . ever since we've been friends she's mostly just smiled and worked hard , keeping a peppy attitude as bright as the sun , but this message .  .  . I can tell she's literally scared to death .  .  . I'm coming Florina , just hang tight !  "   Lyn said to herself , rolling up the parshment and slipping it into her belt as she took off on foot .  The west wing hallway was on the opposite side of the barracks where several of the pegasus and wyvern riders within the heroic army were bunked at .  With her boot's gruff and heavy steps echoing along the walls , Lyn had no intention of slowing down , even if she were to get lost .  Running out of breath from exhaustion , Lyn began to huff and puff aloud .  The last battle required and overwhelming abundance of movement , so having to run so far was quite the struggle .  Sure enough , after what seemed like ten to twenty minutes , she saw Florina's bright violet hair practically glowing as she sat against the wall .  She was huddled up , curled in a ball with her head being buried into her legs .  It was clear to Lyn now that Florina had completely fallen apart . \
  "  Florina ! I'm here !  "   Lyn cried out as she came to a lazy stop .  She desperately tried to catch her breath , watching Florina as she raised her head reveal a face covered in tears .  Florina immediately rose to her feet , charging Lyn like a battering ram until she was able to latch her arms around her like a vice grip . \
  "  Lyn .  .  . oh Lyn .  .  . I'm .  .  . I'm so glad you're here !  "   Florina sobbed loudly , pressing her face into Lyn's upper chest .  Lyn simply sighed , a small smile forming on her face as she held Florina's head close to her . \
  "  Florina , what is this letter about ? I understood what I read , but I want to hear it from you ,  "   Lyn's words drifted slowly into Florina's ears , helping her to steady herself enough to speak .  She began desperately wiping the tears from her eyes , desperately steadying her breath in the process .  Lyn placed her hand firmly on Florina's arms , helping her to calm her nerves . \
  "  I-I'm sorry Lyn .  .  . I just .  .  . that dream seemed so real , as if it could happen at any moment .  I .  .  . I have strong feelings for you that I can't hide anymore , for a fear it may be too late .  Lyn .  .  . I-I love you !  "   Florina cried , gazing into Lyn's eyes which had now widened for a moment . \
  "  You .  .  . love me ? OK Florina , you can calm down now , I'm right here .  You don't to say things just to get me to stay with you .  So what is this really a .  .  .   "   Lyn tried to jokingly play off of Florina's words but her lips were sealed shut by Florina's .  Lyn couldn't believe her eyes as Florina's close shut , tears sliding down her cheeks from the corners of them .  Lyn was paralyzed in place until their lips parted , with Florina breaking free of Lyn's grasp and turning away . \
  "  I'm sorry ! I'm sorry ! I .  .  . I just feel that .  .  .   "   Florina's sobbing fit was about to begin once more but instead she felt the loving embrace of Lyn's arms wrapping around her waist .  She flinched as Lyn gave her a small , affectionate squeeze .  Lyn rested her forehead to the back of Florina's head as she began to speak once more . \
  "  Shh , shh .  .  . it's OK Florina .  .  . I'm not mad at you .  .  .   "   Lyn whispered as she turned Florina around to face her .  Florina's face was now flushed as red as a cherry with her eyes refusing to look into Lyn's as if it were a mortal sin .  Lyn sighed softly , gently placing her hand upon Florina's cheek to turn her eyes towards her . \
  "  Florina .  .  . there's nothing wrong with confessing your love to the person you care so dearly for .  Right now , I don't honestly know how to react to it .  But I can tell you that I don't think it's wrong by any means .  Florina , you said you thought your dream was a preminition of sorts .  Would you mind elaborating on that for me ?  "   Lyn said , wipeing Florina's tears away with the arm of her blouse .  Florina forced a smile on her face as she finally looked Lyn dead in the eyes . \
  "  I think .  .  . it means that I'm going to be sent back home soon .  .  . much like many of the heroes here in this world , once a certainly task was completed , it was only a matter of time before they were returned to their world .  Normally I would never look so deeply into a dream , but this time it seemed very real ,  "   Florina said with a hefty sigh , finally pulling her nerves together so that she could compose herself appropriately . \
  "  I see .  .  . that is rather scary considering how you feel for me .  I can't imagine how I would feel if I was in love with someone , only to have them torn away from me .  Florina .  .  . I can't whole heartedly say that I love you , but .  .  . if you feel this strongly for me .  .  . I suppose that we could share some time together .  I think that dream is silly and I doubt it would send you away from here , but I can tell that these feelings are real and not part of some desperate attempt at trying to fight back loneliness .  So um .  .  . what did you want to do ?  "   Lyn asked , her face a nervous and confused as Florina smiled back at her . \
  "  Well .  .  . if you don't mind .  .  . could we go out in the field ? Like in my dream ? I would like very much to spend time with you like that ,  "   Florina said , grasping her hands together behind her as her gaze kept shifting to and from Lyn's face .  She was like a schoolgirl confessing to her first crush .  Lyn couldn't help but let a small laugh leave her throat with a kind smile following in its aftermath . \
  "  Sure , I would like that ,  "   Lyn said .  She offered her arm to Florina as if she were a gentleman , which Florina grasped onto hesitantly .  As they slowly made their way down the hall , Florina loosened her grasp on Lyn's arm to instead grasp a hold of her hand .  Lyn smiled , lacing her fingers with Florina's , giving it a loving squeeze to show good will .  It did surprise Lyn how dead the barracks truly were ; normally they'd be seeing other units by now , but she just figured it was a lazy day for everyone .  As they grew closer , Lyn smirked at Florina then took off on foot , signaling for her to chase her down .  Florina returned the grin with a smile , running as fast as she could to keep up with the swift swordswoman . \
Hurrying along , the two young ladies quickly made it to the exit of the barracks , bursting from its confines and out into the open world .  They both continued to laugh as their feet brushed against the soft blades of grass that laid beneath them with every step , flowing away with the wind of their speed .  Lyn then came to a screeching hault as they came upon one of the famed flower gardens that Askr was quite fond of .  Florina wasn't paying attention however and collided with Lyn , falling upon her with a loud poomf .  Florina covered her mouth as her face grew dark red as she stared in Lyn's eyes .  Lyn smirked and shrugged her shoulders , blowing a burst of warm air into her face .  Florina took the hint and rolled onto her back , now side by side with Lyn as their eyes were raised to the sky . \
  "  It's been awhile since I've seen a sky so clear .  I think that last time I saw a sky such as this is when I went back to visit the plains where I was raised .  Nothing beats a beautiful day with good friends and good cheer .  Wouldn't you agree Florina ?  "   Lyn asked , turning her head to face Florina's .  Florina's face was already waiting , smiling and blushing lovingly as her hand crawled into Lyn's .  At this very moment , Florina felt that her life was truly complete , as if there were nothing else that could create such a perfect feeling in her heart . \
  "  Can you show me how to make a flower crown Florina ? I've never really tried doing things like that before ,  "   Lyn said , picking out a flower to take a sniff of .  After admiring it for a moment , she then shifted to Florina to gently slide it into her overabundance of hair that made her appearance to warm .  Florina shut her eyes and blushed , a big smile curling upon her lips with Lyn's touch . \
  "  Sure ! I would love to !  "   Florina said immediately getting up on her hands and knees to scrounge out good flowers for the task .  Lyn also raised up , sitting with her legs crossed as she watched Florina's venturing . \
  "  She really is cute huh ?  "   Lyn said quietly as Florina began to hum , picking out flower after flower until she had enough to fill her arms full of them .  She then plopped back over next to Lyn unloading the large abundance of beautiful flowers before them .  Little by little , Florina showed Lyn the process of making the beautiful crown ; Lyn was amazed at how good Florina was with her hands , and how quickly she was able to intertwine the stems and shifting the buds to easily .  It took no time at all before Florina finished the head dress .  It was a dazzling display of colors , easily covering each member of a rainbow's family .  Lyn then lowered her head as if she were bowing to a noble , lowering down enough so that Florina could place it upon her head and adjust it accordingly .  After a few moment , Florina released Lyn's head , smiling with grand joy at her handiwork . \
  "  You looks so pretty with that crown on your head ! You really are sightly aren't you ? OK , now its your turn ,  "   Florina grinned as Lyn looked down at the flowers , intimidated by her task .  Unlike Florina , Lyn struggled the whole way through .  Whenever she would try to intertwine stems correctly , one would either snap or it would fall to pieces .  Florina giggled each time she saw Lyn grow flustrated from frustration , puffing out her cheek in irritation before trying again .  In the end however , Lyn managed to piece one together well enough that it wouldn't simply fall apart . \
  "  Wow Lyn , you're a natural ,  "   Florina said , lowering her head this time .  Lyn shrugged and smirked , lightly placing it on her head as well .  In that moment , Lyn felt a strange sensation in her chest .  She wasn't sure if it was because they were sharing an activity or if she had chosen just the right flowers , but looking at Florina with the crown of flowers she had just made being displayed before her , her heart began to race .  Lyn couldn't place a finger on it , but everything about Florina as of the very moment seemed like she was perfect in every way .  Knowing that Florina would be thrilled over the news , she gently grasped a hold of her hand and smiled . \
  "  Florina .  .  . I want you feel something .  .  .   "   Lyn said , placing Florina's shakey hand over her heart .  Florina's face grew flushed and her eyes fluttered in disbelief ; Lyn's heart was beating just as vigorously as her own .  She gazed down at her hand , then back up at Lyn , whose face slowly closed in onto hers until finally , she decided that their lips should grow more familiar with one another .  .  Florina's heart fluttered with overwhelming joy as Lyn pulled her body close with a warm embrace like that of a lover .  Lyn's eyes stayed locked on Florina's as she retreated her lips , brushing Florina's violet bangs to the side so that her eyes were easier to see . \
  "  My mother once told me that love does not follow a plan nor does it follow any rules .  To a heart truly in love status , gender , and thing of those sorts no longer matters nor matters to start with .  Love is an overwhelming force of nature that can't be extinguished .  Looking in your eyes right now Florina , I can see now that my mother had never spoken words so true ; you are the embodiement of love Florina , and I want to thank you for sharing that love with me ,  "   Lyn's words struck at Florina's heart like a cupids arrow ; all of Florina's dreams , her hopes , and her desires were all blossoming to life like a million flowers planted in her soul .  Laying back they both decided to gaze up into the cloudy evening , Florina now sprawled against Lyn has they kept their hands latched together .  The amount of time they had was quickly lost as they both found themselves falling into a light slumber ; with the warm wind and the beautiful sky surrounding them , it was next to impossible to resist .  The blissful rest carried on for Lyn while poor Florina's nightmare came back to haunt her .  Quickly stirring awake , she gazed over at the peaceful Lyn ; she still couldn't believe the small exchanges of love that she had recieved on this very afternoon , nor would she ever forget them at all .  Looking up , she could now see that their light and fluffy clouds had grown dismal and dark . \
  "  A storm is coming .  .  .   "   Florina sighed , nudging Lyn awake as she felt a raindrop hit her hair .  Lyn woke up , groggy and grumpy from being distrubed for her peacefuly rest .  Lyn's eyes and mouth then smiled when returning to Florina's , remembering why she felt so at ease . \
  "  I'm sorry about that Florina , I must've dosed off .  .  .   "   Lyn said , wiping her eyes .  Florina let out a small giggle before rising to her feet , offering her hand out to Lyn as raindrops began to spit from the sky . \
  "  We should probably go inside now , I can tell its about to storm ,  "   Flarina said as Lyn grasped a hold of her hand .  Having been in such bliss earlier in the day , they had totally forgotten the distance they had traveled to reach their colorful destination .  Running and laughing , Lyn and Florina found themselves being swallowed up by the storm .  They were soon soaked from head to toe as the rain came roaring down , their steps growing harder and harder to make .  It wasn't for another 5 minutes that they actually made it back to the barracks , leaving them like a pair of wet cats being out in the rain . \
  "  Hey .  .  . would you like to come to my chambers to  .  .  . warm up ? I .  .  . really want to be with you tonight .  .  .   "   Lyn said with a nervous smirk , eyeing Florina intently .  Florina simply let another giggle fill her throat , grasping a hold of Lyn's hand tightly so that she could lead the way .  The both of them blushed as their hearts raced , knowing that this night would certainly be one to remember .  Shivering from anxiousness and rain soaked clothes , they finally made it to Lyn's room within a matter of minutes .  Lyn quickly flung the door open , holding it open for Florina before closing it behind them .  Lyn immediately took the initiative to shed her clothing in the corner of her luke warm , cozy room .  Florina couldn't help but to just watch as Lyn's toned , succulent frame graced the open air , displaying itself in plain sight .  After removing her tie to let her hair loose , Lyn turned around to see Florina's face glowing as bright as a strawberry , her legs knocking together as she slowly approached her . \
  "  You need to get out of those clothes Florina or else you'll catch a cold ,  "   Lyn smiled , moving behind her to help her remove her armor from her body .  The two of them grew more and more anxious by the second , being very easily noticed from the way that Lyn's hands began to fumble with latches and how Florina was so coy to shedding her soaked duds .  Lyn took in the flowery scent of Florina's drenched hair as she wrapped her arms around her wait from behind , the both of them now shivering like mad against each other .  The warmth from their bodies however helped cast the cold chills aside , Florina now turning to return her gaze to her love . \
  "  Can we .  .  . get on the bed ?  "   Florina's words shook as Lyn placed her strong hands firmly on Florina's shoulders .  Lyn's breathing grew heavy with her vigorous , anctious heart pounding in her chest .  Lyn couldn't wait any longer , pressing her body and lips passionately against Florina's as she moved her onto the bed .  Lyn's tongue made way between Florina's quivering lips , tapping innocently against hers as her hand explored to rub against Florina's warm , moist crevice .  Florina's whines filled Lyn's mouth , her juices now coating Lyn's aggressive fingers .  Florina boldly raised up her left hand as well , gently sliding her fingers through Lyn's in return . \
  "  T-This feels really strange .  .  . I'm not really sure but .  .  . I-I kind of like it .  .  .   "   Lyn gasped , her eyes growing heavy from her raising body heat .  Lyn paused to allow Florina to explore her nether region ; Florina smiled in delight as she got up to switch places with Lyn sitting her down at the edge of her bed .  Lyn nervously watched as Florina carefully lowered down to her between her legs , removing all of her scrunches and holds from her hair to let it drape down to dry . \
  "  This may sound strange to you but .  .  . you're really beautiful Lyn .  I can't believe that I'm able to help the one I love in this way .  .  .   "   Florina's words shook as she slowly slid Lyn's legs apart .  Lyn couldn't help but to stare at Florina as she kissed up her inner thighs , her tongue slipping out and dragging along until she reached the very middle .  Florina slid her tongue back out as she turned her eyes up to look up at Lyn , slowly moving forward to smoosh its hot , slick surface in between Lyn's nether lips .  At the very press of Florina's tongue , Lyn felt as if she were shocked by electricity , immediately grasping a hold of her sheets in surprise .  Moans and whines forced their way out of her mouth , like an unstoppable force caused by Florina's actions . \
  "  A-Ah this is .  .  . it's overwhelming .  .  .  !  "   Lyn cried out as Florina dug her tongue in deeper , gently placing her hands on Lyn's inner thighs to keep them from clenching onto her .  Florina couldn't help but to remove one of her hands and slide it down to her own crevice , now rubbing it helplessly at the sound of Lyn's uncontrollable sounds of lust .  Lyn shook and shivered , using every inch of her will to try and stay still for her Florina .  Florina began to grow dizzy from Lyn's powerful scent as she began to pant and moan audibly for Lyn to hear . \
  "  F-Florina .  .  . I-I .  .  . don't stop .  .  .  !  "   Lyn whined , her hands now shaking vigorously as they weaved their way through Florina's hair .  She couldn't help it any longer as she gently gripped a hold of Florina's hair , her arms now pulling Florina's mouth up against her hot , twitching insides .  Florina found herself rubbing through her crevice harder and harder the more rough that Lyn became , the sounds of her muffled whines and cries reverbirating into Lyn's passion . \
Lyn suddenly fell back ; her hands gripped onto Florina's head tightly , her legs now tense and shaking .  She immediately clasped her free hand over her mouth as she began to scream out in pleasure .  Florina panted and whine lovingly , her whole body being overwhelmed with lust as she made her partner climax .  The more Florina continued to forcefully move her mouth into her , the more and more Lyn's screams sprung to life .  Finally , Florina decided that she should let her lover breathe , stopping her tongue and movements so that Lyn would finally let go .  Lyn's body began to twitch and shiver as she desperately panted for air , the new sensation of being loved driving all of her senses over the edge . \
  "  Hehe .  .  . I'm glad you liked that .  You taste and um .  .  . smell really good down there , s-so good that I couldn't stop .  .  .   "   Florina's face lit a blaze as she wiped her mouth off , moving so that she was laying down next to the desperately recovering Lyn .  Lyn felt all thoughts and logic melt away , leaving her to do nothing but feel as she took in Florina's love for her .  Lyn suddenly leaned her face towards Florina , instinctively dragged her tongue against the nape of Florina's neck .  Florina froze then cried out , whimpering loudly as she explored it with more energy than before . \
  "  L-Lyn ? ! M-my neck .  .  . keep pleasuring my neck .  .  .  !  "   Florina's body and mind began to tremble mindlessly , immediately grasping a hold of Lyn's hand and forcing it between her legs .  Lyn couldn't believe how Florina acted out in response ; she had never taken her for one to give into such desires , much less selfish take them .  Lyn found it rather cute at how much Florina wanted more , obliging her every gensture lovingly .  Lyn decided to straddle Florina's leg , gently gasping as her cool , wet snatch smooshed against it so she could get into a better position . \
Lyn began kissing and licking at her neck viciously , hooking two of her fingers inside of Florina to see her reaction as she ground her ladyhood on Florina's leg .  Florina immediately cried out , strangling Lyn's hand as she helped her force them in deeper , her hips wildly moving with it .  Lyn then raised up her head to look at poor Florina , whose eyes were half closed and her tongue panting sounds .  Lyn smirked and took the opportunity to gently graze Florina's tongue with her lips , eventually sucking it in to kiss her passionately .  Lyn grew more and more aggressive until Florina could take no more , crying over and over again in Lyn's mouth like a helpless puppy as she tried clenched her legs around Lyn's hand as she climaxed . \
  "  This is so crazy , I have absolutely no words to describe this feeling ,  "   Lyn said as her red face grew worse , now smiling once more into Florina's exausted face .  Florina hefty breaths slowly subsided as she turned her gaze to Lyn , reaching up to run a hand through her hair as they're minds and souls felt as if they were one . \
  "  Like you mother said Lyn , love is follows no plan and no rules .  It's an overhwelming force of nature that can't simply be stopped nor put into words .  I'm not sure if this is true love or not , but whatever it is , I don't want it to stop ,  "   Florina said as her hand moved to wipe some of Lyn's sweat from her brow .  Lyn simply replied with a kiss on lips , her forehead gently resting against Florina's .  Lyn crawled up on the bed , slowly pulling Florina into her arms so that they could lay chest to chest .  Florina sighed contently , lowering down a little to rest her head on Lyn's bossom .  She nuzzled into them to get comfortable , leading to a soft laugh from Lyn's mouth .  Lyn reached over the small table that sat at her bedside , grasping a brush that she used nearly every morning to tend to her overwhelming green hair that caused a fuss each day .  Slowly she began dragging it through Florina's thick locks , smoothing it out from the rain causing it to curl .  With every brush stroke , Florina made small hums that gradually turned into a sweet melody before she knew it . \
  "  What song is that Florina ? Its really pretty ,  "   Lyn asked as she moved the brush behind Florina's neck .  Florina sighed softly in content , nuzzling up against Lyn's chest once more . \
  "  It was a song of my mother's .  It's what she would always hum and sing whenever she would do simple things such as housework , but she always sang it to me without fail whenever she would help me brush my hair ,  "   Florina said , giving Lyn's body a small affectionate squeeze . \
  "  Do you remember the lyrics ? I would love to hear you sing them ,  "   Lyn said as she fought through some tangles that got in her brushes path .  Florina's slowly closed her eyes , taking a small breath to steady her nerves so that her voice would not waver . \
  "  Once I thought I was all alone , cold and sad , with a broken home .  That things were awful and days were gray , I thought there was no escaping this fray .  But then I felt a warmth in my heart , the sun's gaze that would never part , thats when you came into my life and said , I love you with all of my heart .  Days from then were bright and nice , not a day went by that was cold as ice .  So now we're here together still , forever in arms , with a love so real ,  "   Florina softly sang line by line carefully so to not miss a single note .  Lyn found tears filling in her eyes whenever Florina would occasionally look up and smile ; it was if she was truly singing about herself . \
  "  That's such a beautiful song .  .  . you must have a wonderful mother Florina .  Does it have a name ?  "   Lyn said as she wiped her eyes , dragging the brush down to the end of her hairs . \
  "  The song is called Dear Heart .  She's the reason I am who I am today ; not a day went by that I didn't want to be more like a my mother .  She was so kind and loving , selfless , and genuine , and I knew right away that I wanted to be like that .  It's a little embarassing to be honest , not a whole lot of people do that sort of thing you know ?  "   Florina softly laughed as Lyn finished up the end of her hairs .  Florina looked up at Lyn as her brush tapped back onto the table , Lyn's tears shimmering in the dim light .  Florina then turned over , moving up to kiss each tear away before kissing Lyn's lips lovingly . \
  "  I hope that we can have more time like this together now ; this is something that I've never truly felt before and well .  .  . I felt it was something that I was always lacking .  But having you here right now really gives me a whole new reason for living .  I never knew love like this could be so strong , you know ?  "   Lyn said , gently running her hand through Florina's freshly brushed silky hair , gently rubbing her body up against hers . \
  "  Lyn .  .  . I .  .  . I have something to say but .  .  . it's kind of hard to .  .  . there was another reason I sent you that note .  I .  .  . I think that the dream is more than just a dream Lyn .  I think it means that .  .  . its .  .  .   "   Florina's voice filled with vast hesitation , as if the very words that would leave them next would cause the world to end in a matter of seconds .  Lyn caressed Florina's cheek softly with the back of her hand , Florina reaching up to hold it in place as she tried to speak . \
  "  I might be sent back to our world soon Lyn .  .  . I don't know how , and I don't know why , but I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that I may not be here for much longer .  That's .  .  . the other reason I had to tell you .  .  . that I .  .  . that I .  .  .   "   Florina's words began to grow muddled with gasps of sadness , tears now beginning to fall from the duct of her eyes as she continued to keep her gaze on Lyn's .  Lyn simply smiled , wrapping her arms around her as hard as she could to hold her close . \
  "  It's OK Florina .  .  . it's OK .  .  . it doesn't matter right now does it ? Right now you're right here in my arms and in my heart .  Don't let such thoughts ruin this moment for us .  If it is to happen , there's .  .  . there's nothing we can do I guess .  But right now there is something we can do ,  "   Lyn's eyes lined with tears as well as she put all of her heart and soul into being strong for Florina ; she could tell she was pushing through everything for her benefit as well as her own , it was a true testament to her feelings that she had discovered this very day . \
  "  Right now your right here with me , and I will never let you go ,  "   Lyn said , reaching behind Florina's head to move her lips to her own .  Their tears met at the middle of their cheeks as their mouths passionate embrace engaged one anothers .  Lyn's hands slid down Florina's back , gently ending up on her rear to which she gave a small squeeze , prompting a soft moan to leave Florina's throat .  Lyn gently raised up her leg , allowing Florina's crotch to rest upon it before moving her hips on her own .  As their lips parted , Florina's smiled and gasped with a soft laugh , her left hand gently grasping Lyn's breast in return . \
  "  Then let's spend it with love ,  "   Florina whispered , lower down her head to kiss upon Lyn's breast .  Lyn heaved her chest into Florina's lips , holding her head there as she rose her leg .  Florina left a slick trail of her fluids along Lyn's leg as she ground on it passionately , letting out moans and whimpers against each kiss on Lyn's chest .  Florina reached up with her other hand , now messaging each of Lyn's breasts as she pleasured them , causing Lyn to cry out lovingly with each caress .  Lyn's hands returned to Florina's rear , grasping it firmly and using her own strength to help Florina's warm , moist crotch thrust upon her leg .  With each stroke on Lyn's leg , Florina let out a moan into her breasts , now licking and kissing across them with fierce passion behind each motion . \
The closer Florina's body grew towards a climax , the more aggressive her mouth became .  Florina began to ride Lyn's leg vigorously , now squeezing , sucking and kissing on Lyn's breasts aggressively .  Harder and harder she went , her whole system losing control as Lyn grasped a hold of her cheeks .  She continued to message Lyn's breasts roughly as Lyn's lips smooshed harshly against her own , moaning out into her mouth as they both began to quiver and cry lovingly .  Florina's cute cries whined against Lyn's mouth over and over again as she tensed up , her fluids now soaking Lyn's leg with its warmth .  Their lips parted with their tongues being connected by a thin string of saliva as her body calmed , now relaxing against her lover's .  The string snapped as Florina's energy depleted , her body now twitching and squirming in Lyn's arms . \
  "  I .  .  . love you Lyn , with all of my heart .  I wish I could stay up longer , but I'm starting to feel a bit weak .  .  . and .  .  . tired  "   Florina yawned regretfully , her eyes beginning to grow drowzy from fatigue .  Lyn wasn't sure what her heart truly thought of Florina .  Everything had happened so quickly .  Thinking on it for merely a moment , Lyn knew that one way or another , she was the happiest girl in the world to be in this situation right now . \
  "  I love you too Florina , I think we should rest now .  You look like you're about to .  .  .   "   before Lyn could even finish her sentance , she saw that Florina just passed out .  Lyn let a small giggle breach the air , planting a kiss on Florina's forehead before pulling the covers over them . \
  "  I'm glad we could share this time together with you Florina , it is a time I will never forget ,  "   Lyn whispered softly as she pulled Florina's back to her chest , wrapping her arms around her to keep her safe this very night .  Come morning , Lyn stirred awake from her pleseant slumber as the light from the sun beamed in her eyes .  Sitting up in her bed , she went to reach next to her , only to find nothing but a note laying in the wake .  Lyn slowly brought the note to her focusing eyes , with the lyrics of Florina's song being written out in that beautiful font that she had used on a note the night before .  Lyn flipped it over then smiled softly , a small tear forming in her eye . \
  "  Lyn , it seems that my time has come after all .  Its a strange sensation .  .  . I feel my body heating up with my vision going white .  Perhaps this is similar to how we came into this world .  .  . Lyn , I love you , I can't truly express how much I do in words but know that its quite a bit .  You have no idea how much this past night as meant to me .  Even if I am to die tomorrow , I would be able to pass without any regrets .  Lyn , we may never meet again , but no matter where you are , just know that your love will always be in my heart and hopefully my love will have found a place in yours .  Farewell Dear Heart , Florina ,  "   Lyn read to herself , wiping the tears from her eyes . \
  "  Yeah , I'm sure we'll meet again Florina .  Just wait for me , alright ?  "   Lyn said with a smile as she gave the beautiful note a strong hug .  She began to attempt to sing the song that Florina had left the lyrics for , but found that her singing voice was a bit off .  Instead she just decided to hum the melody , just as she had did for her . \
  "  Ugh .  .  . not again .  .  .   "   Effie groaned as she stared at the destroyed training dummy before her .  The basic training regamine within the walls of Askr's barracks was fairly simple unless instructed otherwise .  With this in mind , many of the heroes from all over time often spend their time in the training area .  Sparring with one another or training dummies for hitting were the only real choices .  Fearing that she might actually hurt someone , Effie often takes to the training dummies for practice .  Unfortunately however , this was the third dummy she had broken this week alone , and they weren't exactly easy to construct due to their lack of resources . \
  "  You should try using your strength to stop your blows and destorying with them .  .  . what kind of trainin' is that ? Though , they won't be too thrilled for destroying another one ,  "   Effie sighed as she sat back on a bench and partook in some water .  Unlike Effie however , many of the swordsman , axeman , and lancers that attacked the training dummies found it more than a little difficulty to actually damage and break them .  Even mighty heroes like Chrom would be putting all their strength into their training , leaving with a good workout instead of regrets and time wasted .  Popping her neck , she rose back onto her feet , grabbing her lance off the ground to return to her normal stature . \
Walking back to another dummy , she decided it would be better to practice moving with her swings instead of just using her brute force .  Laying down her shield , she took the lance into both hands , taking a swing at the dummy from overhead .  Effie shouted with her strength immediately taking off the head of the dummy .  She sighed then practiced quick thrusts , each one leaving a remarkable dent in the dummy's chest and stomach .  Taking thrust after thrust , the dummy eventually snapped off of its harness , broken and chopped up into two pieces .  She shrugged off the broken dummy . \
  "  Maybe I should get some food , I'm starting to get a little grumpy ,  "   Effie said .  As she turned to head towards the corridor away from the training room , yells of nager and determination grabbed a hold of her ears .  She turned around to see a large man with an axe , chopping down dummy after dummy with single swings .  Effie stared in amazement ; never before had she seen such raw power out of anyone but herself .  Ontop of his might , he had the looks of a powerful lord , which caught her eye immediately .  Curiously , she made her way over to where the mighty fought , leaning his rather large axe against the post of another destroyed dummy . \
  "  Whew ! I was able to get five down with one go this time , not too shabby if I say so myself ,  "   Hector said , wiping his brow .  He felt light shaking of the ground coming from his right , immediately turning his attention to the rather large woman that stood before him . \
  "  Your might is amazing friend , I've never seen such raw power in someone else before ,  "   Effie said , her usual composure slightly wayning from Hector's presence .  Hector laughed and shook his head , picking his axe back up and resting it on his shoulder . \
  "  And your quite the woman to be able to carry all that armor .  You must struggle to get around ,  "   Hector said with a grin .  Effie huffed , ready to prove to Hector that the armor wasn't just for show . \
  "  Not really , it actually feels pretty light .  My shield and my armor are like clothes to me ,  "   Effie replied .  Hector tilted his head to the side , really getting a good look at her whole body and the armor she so casually wore . \
  "  She must have one hell of a figure underneath that armor if its as heavy as she says .  .  . that's a lot of weight to lift on an everyday basis ,  "   Hector smirked , gazing over her once more .  Effie couldn't help but to feel a little warm from Hector's gaze , after all , she was still a woman .  She shook it off as he held out his hand . \
  "  Let me feel how heavy that shield is , the way you move around with it it seems like it'd be pretty light ,  "   Hector said as Effie mashed the bottom of it in the ground with a poomf , leaving it upright . \
  "  It'll be easier if you grab it while its standing up ,  "   Effie replied casually .  Effie stepped back to allow Hector get beside it .  Gripping the handle inside tightly , he then hoist the heavy metal out of the ground and into the air . \
  "  Good God .  .  . how can a woman carry this in her off hand ? ! Even I'm slightly struggling with it .  .  . it seems I've underestimated her abilities ,  "   Hector said to himself as he shifted around with her shield in his hand .  Effie was amazed to see someone who could even lift her shield , much less move around with it so fluidly .  Stopping his quick movements , Hector stopped and let the shield fall back into its current place , digging itself into the ground like a sign post . \
  "  Most impressive , that's a fine shield you wield .  It's pretty astonishing to find a woman with so much strength .  You must train everyday don't you ?  "   Hector asked as Effie effortlessly removed her shield from the ground . \
  "  Eat .  Move .  Train .  With each meal that I have , its putting another brick on the wall that I serve to be , how about you ? What's your training like ?  "   Effie replied .  Hector took note of the simple routine , wondering if that was actually enough for such strength to be achieved .  However , Hector wasn't one to over think things and took it at base value . \
  "  It's very simple , I just keep swinging my axe .  If I wish for more weight , I simply latch on things like logs and stones , things that I can keep in place with rope .  From time to time , as my axe wears down , I have it reforged , and tell the smith to make it larger or to use heavier metals in its construction .  If you want you can try picking it up and swinging it a little , go ahead , just be careful not to let it drag you around instead of the other way around ,  "   Hector grinned , pointing over to his axe that rested against the post .  Effie laid down her shield and lance as she approached the intimidating weapon of death .  She noticed while Hector was training with it that he was swinging it around with one hand , so with a brave attempt , Effie tried to raise it with a single arm .  Grasping a hold of it tightly , Effie slowly lifted it into the air , her arm actually struggling from the sheer weight of the mighty axe . \
  "  Whoa .  .  . this thing really IS heavy ,  "   Effie groaned , lifting it up to rest it on her shoudler .  In that position she was able to relax , it was like lifting a person and swinging them around .  Giving it a few swings with both hands , she found that Hector's words rang true , finding it difficult to maintain her center of balance with each hefty swing . \
  "  What is this thing made out of ? I'd love to get a shield this heavy for trainin' ,  "   Effie asked in astonishment , attempting to swing with one hand with minimal difficulty . \
  "  Its made of pure , tempered silver , one of the heaviest materials in Ostia .  Getting a shield of that size made from this material would literally cost a soldier 4 years of pay .  I'm not sure how it is where your from , but you would have to have some serious gold to reenforce that monster of a shield ,  "   Hector said with a chuckle .  Effie smiled back at the kind lord's words , she hadn't ever met anyone quite like him before , and meeting him now was a pleseant surprise .  Carefully handing the axe back to him , Effie then smirked and grabbed her shield and lance back up off the ground . \
  "  Sorry but I gotta go , I gotta find Lady Elise and see how she's doing .  I'm going to be trading off with her other retainer so that he can have some time to himself .  Hopefully we can spar sometime , I'd love to see what you're capable of ,  "   Effie said , nodding her head and turning away . \
  "  Hey ! I never got your name !  "   Hector called out quickly , not letting her move another inch .  She stopped dead in her tracks , turning only a slight to capture his view . \
  "  I'm Effie , retainer to Lady Elise , Princess of Nohr .  And you are ?  "   Effie replied .  Hector shot her a big smirk as he rested his axe on his shoulder . \
  "  I'm Hector , head General of Ostia .  How about we spar tonight instead of later ? Surely you train in the evening as you do in the morning and afternoon .  What do you say to that ?  "   Hector asked , popping his neck after removing his axe from his shoulder . \
  "  I'd like that , see you later then ,  "   Effie said with a smile as she turned and trounced away .  Eliwood caught wind of the conversation seeing that he was training none too far from their position .  With a smirk , he sheathed Durandal , turning towards Hector with curiosity in his eyes as he approached him . \
  "  Who was that woman ? She looked like she could wrestle a bear ,  "   Eliwood smirked , at Hector , very aware of what type of women he was attracted to .  Hector let his axe hit the ground head first , now using it as a stand . \
  "  That right there Eliwood was a REAL woman .  Her name is Effie , she's apparently a retainer for a princess here ,  "   Hector replied . \
  "  Effie huh , that's a rather feminine name for a woman so brutish .  That's one lucky princess because there isn't much that I could see taking that woman down .  I saw a bit of chemistry between the two of you , I don't suppose you're trying to make way with that woman are you ?  "   Eliwood replied with a chuckle , causing Hector to turn to him , his face chisseled with confidence . \
  "  You better believe it , women like that are rarer than diamonds and jewels .  Just picture what her body will look like when all that armor's off of her frame , quite the sight isn't it ?  "   Hector suggested , nudging Eliwood in the side .  Eliwood closed his eyes and thought for a moment , trying to picture her as Hector saw her . \
  "  Her physique would certainly be nothing short of extroadinary , a bit too much for me though ,  "   Eliwood said with laugh , giving Hector a firm pat on his shoulder .  It was rare that Hector really spoke up about a woman , so Eliwood knew there had to be something special about her that a normal man wouldn't be able to see .  After about 15 minutes of trouncing around , Effie finally found Elise , who was smiling and laughing with one of the young dragon girls that were spread throughout the Askran barracks . \
  "  Wow ! You can turn into a big dragon just like my big brother and sister ? ! That's so cool !  "   Elise said , giggling with the young Tiki that sat before her on the ground . \
  "  It's nothing too special , I mean several of us young dragons can transform without any difficulty at all .  What's truly remarkable is that you would openly confront each of us with such grand kindness .  Back in my world , that would be the bravest of the brave ,  "   Tiki's posh accent rang , both of them still smiling and laughing .  Effie just smiled as she watched at a short distance , trying not to disturb the young princess during her social time .  Arthur quickly noticed Effie making her way towards them , jumping into action and rushing to her side . \
  "  Welcome back dear Effie , Elise is having a bountifully good time with some of the apparent younger members of the barracks , why I haven't seen her smile in such a way in years !  "   Arthur proclaimed , reinforcing Effie's smile to keep it on her face . \
  "  That's great .  Ready to switch ? It's time for my shift to watch her ,  "   Effie said , Arthur seemed astonished at the time , as if it had run past him without a single hint . \
  "  My has it been that long ? I hadn't even noticed .  To be honest I was hoping that I could stay on a bit further , the stories that this young dragon carries are truly remarkable ! You could stay with us and listen in if you would like ,  "   Arthur replied , moving next to Elise and plopping to her side .  Crossing his legs , he began to listen in as curiously as Elise as Tiki began to telling them of another tale when she was accompanying Marth and Caeda .  Effie simply smirked , shaking her head then giving Arthur a firm pat on the shoulder . \
  "  It's all you , I'm going to get something to eat ,  "   Effie said quietly before moving on from their position .  The mess hall was like a second home to Effie ; whenever she was done training , unless she was Elise , she would immediately make her way there to fuel up for another training session .  All of the chefs had to prep themselves diligently and quickly whenever Effie enters the room or else they won't be able to meet her demand of food that she so graciously eats one piece at a time .  Today was no exception , immediately piling all forms of meat , dairy , and vegies that she would then be ingesting for the next 20 minutes . \
  "  I better eat up , I don't want to lose my sparring match later .  I gotta continue to prove to Lady Elise that no one can best me in a test of strength ,  "   Effie said , grabbing a roll to dig her pearly white teeth into .  It wasn't uncommon for others to stare at the mass amounts that she ate , in fact many watched on in amazement as she would devour everything , leaving nothing left .  This time however , she found her face grow a slight bit warm as Hector walked in and locked his sights on her . \
  "  That's quite a plate you got there , do you plan to eat that all on your own ?  "   Hector said , sitting across from her at the table .  Effie gazed into his dark , powerful eyes then returned her attention to her plate , her stomach practically eating itself . \
  "  This is nothin' , I can eat a lot more than this , but I only do that when there's a tough battle ahead that requires endurance ,  "   Effie said , destroying the roll with her hunger then grabbing a hold of a chicken leg . \
  "  I've never seen a woman with such a large appetite , very impressive ,  "   Hector said , propping his chin in his hand as he watched .  Her eyes kept shifting from her food and back to him repetitively as she continued to indulge in her plethra of food , curious as to why he would sit and stare at her further . \
  "  Is there somethin' you need Hector ?  "   Effie paused , ferociously chewing her food as she returned her eyes to his once more . \
  "  Yeah , I thought of a better place for us to spar so we won't cause as much of a ruckus .  What do you say we do it outside ? There a nice clearing just outside of the back gate that would be perfect for our bout ,  "   Hector suggested , still maintaining perfect eye contact with Effie .  She averted her eyes meekly only occasionally returning hers to his . \
  "  Yeah , sure , that'll work ,  "   Effie said dismissively .  Hector simply smirked , rising to his feet as Effie returned her attention to her miniature feast . \
  "  The way he looks at me is so strange .  .  . is he trying to size me up ?  "   Effie said to herself as she dug into another slab of meat .  Hector couldn't help but smirk to himself as he grabbed his axe that was leaning against a pillar just outside the doors to the mess hall . \
  "  I never thought I'd say this , but I'm feeling warm inside for the first time in awhile , I hope she fights as well as she is strong , that will show me if she is what I am looking for ,  "   Hector said , taking a hefty breath before returning to the training area .  The rest of the day ran smoothly ; Arthur and herself accompanied Elise around the barracks , conversing with all the colorful tenants that resided within while Hector prepped himself for the sparing match to which he hoped ended in a victory on multiple fields .  Both Effie and Hector grinned and tightened up their armor as they peered out the windows of the barracks .  The sun beginning to set was the perfect time and weather for a bout , to which niether of them was planning to lose .  Stepping out the back gate of the barracks , Hector waited patiently as Effie made her way to it . \
  "  Sorry to keep you waiting , I had to hustle here from the West Wing ,  "   Effie said , popping her neck .  Hector was yet again amazed ; not only was she incredibly strong , it appeared she was also rather mobile .  Stretching his masculine arms to pop his joints he raised up his axe and let rest upon his shoulder as he awaited Effie to get into position .  Taking a deep breath , she got into her battle stance , waiting for Hector to give the word . \
  "  What do you say we put a wager on this .  The loser has to do whatever the winner wants ,  "   Hector said , smiling like a kid in a candy store .  Effie couldn't see the harm in such a wager , especially she hadn't ever been defeated in one on one combat . \
  "  I accept , now let's get this going !  "   Effie shouted .  Hector immediately took the initiative , charging at Effie like a bull blinded by red .  She stood firm , carefully solidifying her stance to prepare for the first blow .  Hector then leapt forward into the air , shouting as he used both hands to swing down at her .  Effie clenched her teeth as she raised her shield , her whole weight being shoved back by the power of his strike . \
Effie shoved her shield forward , pushing Hector off then taking a firm step forward with a power thrust of her lance .  Hector quickly smacked it aside with his axe before making another fierce swing to her side .  Effie gave out a battle cry as she used her might to bash the axe away , fiercly swing her lance with a wide ranged horizontal swipe .  To her surprise , Hector was able to hault her swing with his heavy arm guard against the staff portion of her lance , snapping his hand around it with a strong grasp before swinging at her again .  Effie tried to tear her lance from his grasp but failed , forcing her to let go of it to use her full strength to push back his axe once more .  Hector threw her lance to the side , grinning as he placed his axe on his shoulder . \
  "  You've been disarmed , ready to surrender ?  "   Hector said confidently .  Suddenly , Effie burst into a sprint , charging as fiercly as she could with her shield held firm .  Hector grunted as he put all of his strength into a swing upon it , the curve of it sliding his axe off before bashing him back .  Effie then quickly retrieved her lance , holding it firmly as she made a charge . \
  "  Don't underestimate me !  "   Effie shouted , borishly swinging the lance horizontally once more .  This time she managed to only have the pointed in at his frame , knocking him to the side after taking a hit to his armor .  He let out a short grunt before returning to his feet completely . \
  "  That hurt pretty good , it looks like this spar is turning into full on combat .  ALRIGHT , NO MORE HOLDING BACK !  "   Hector shouted , whirling his axe over his head as if it were made of air .  Like a mighty steed , Hector began charging Effie at top speed , causing her to quickly shift her position .  Right on top of her , Hector smashed his axe into Effie's shield , cracking it right in the dead center .  Effie's face was staring in disbelief as Hector began tearing her shield apart with massive swing after massive swing . \
  "  Not good , not good !  "   Effie grunted , using her body to shove the shield against him as hard as she could to push off his onslaught of blows .  Hector backed off , breathing heavily as the weight of his axe began to wear him down .  His grin grew wider , noticing that Effie wasn't nearly as worn down as he was since she was merely on defense . \
  "  So that's her game .  .  . no wonder she's so damn tough , she's trained her defenses to be flawless .  This is getting really exciting now !  "   Hector said , wiping his forehead .  His side where he was struck was beginning to burn , the pain slowly sitting in as he regained his breath .  Gritting his teeth he maintained a smile as he continued to stare her down . \
  "  Looks like I have to end this soon or she'll outlast me .  .  . man I hate endurance matches ,  "   Hector said , lifting his axe back onto his shoulder . \
  "  Had enough ? Because I'm far from done over here !  "   Effie shouted out , wiping her sweat from her brow as well . \
  "  If he barrages me like that again , my shield's gonna give out .  .  . I can't believe how strong he is , its like literally tackling a wild bull !  "   Effie said to herself , smirking back at Hector .  Effie then charged Hector with Hector following suit .  With battle cries echoing the air , the two titans clashed with loud stinging scream of metal slicing the air .  Hector swung with all of his might , forcing Effie to guard .  Deflecting the first blow , Effie found her center of balance leave her , forcing to her to shift her frame down to a half kneel .  Striking down on her again , she raised her shield one last time , only to have it turn to scrap metal from the blow . \
  "  I'm not out yet !  "   Effie cried , tossing the useless remains of her trusty shield to the side .  She used her lance to push away from Hector before grasping onto it with both hands .  Immediately gaining her footing , she made strong thrusts at Hector , doing all she could to keep him at her weapon's reach .  Hector narrowly avoided her fierce thrusts , with many close calls that would put him to the ground .  Running out of fuel , Hector began guarding the thrusts with his axe , try to find to the right moment to strike .  Effie then raised up her lance , swinging down as hard as she could over head .  Hector smiled wide as he swung at it like a baseball bat , chopping its steel body in half .  Effie's eyes widened as she found herself unarmed now staring as Hector's gaze faced the ground . \
  "  I guess that means I win .  .  .   "   Hector said , slowly raising his head to see Effie now in his face .  Hector stared in surprise , unable to swing his axe at such close quarters , Effie snapped her vice grip of a grasp onto his arm .  Losing the grip on his axe and being tossed aside , Hector found himself at a loss of words from the exchange . \
  "  I said I'm not out yet !  "   Effie said , smirking as she clashed her grasp with his .  It was if two bears were wrestiling one another , each one fighting for dominance with all their might .  Effie knocked Hector off of her with a stern kick , now throwing a punch at him without hesitation .  Hector growled loudly , grasping her and shifting his weight .  Effie found herself lose her footing , now being put face first into the ground with Hector restraining her arm from behind . \
  "  I said I win ,  "   Hector said with a triumphant laugh .  After struggling for a few minutes , Effie final gave into his power , tapping onto the ground to show that she had given up .  Hector then released her wrist , grasping onto her arm tightly to help her back up to her feet .  Both of them catching their breath , Hector moved over to Effie , who was now using her knees as crutches to stay standing . \
  "  That was a battle well fought , you have got to be one of the toughest opponents I have ever fought .  Your strength , your tenacity , and your devotion , all of these things are in full abundance within you .  I honestly didn't think a woman like you could exist , so finding you now is like finding a true teasure .  Say .  .  . Effie , since I won , why don't we .  .  .   "   Hector's words were cut short as Effie wiped her mouth and rose her head , face red from both exaustion and passion .  She quickly rose up her hands and grasped a hold of his face , pressing her lips firmly to his .  Before he could respond she then backed off from him , now averting her eyes nervously as her blushing grew perfuse . \
  "  I uh .  .  . I'm usually never this bold , and I'm not very good at this stuff .  .  . but I can't stop what my body feels .  .  .   "   Effie said , her powerful voice now shaking .  Hector blunk a few times from surprise then smiled , knowing that his true objective was now achieved . \
  "  I .  .  . feel the same way .  So , since I won , I want you to come with me to my chambers and give me a back message , alright ?  "   Hector said , grabbing his axe from the ground .  Effie smiled warmly , a strange force of passionate emotions coursing through her like a wild river . \
  "  Yeah , I'd like that ,  "   Effie replied .  Walking through the hall was rather awkward ; with both of them drenched in sweat and sharing rosey cheeks , people could easily assume what the two of them were up to .  However , the both of them never cared much about others thoughts , especially now with each other on their minds instead .  A 10 minute walk felt like an hour as they trounced , both of them about to collapse from exaustion and from the massive amounts of weight they both wore , so finally getting to Hector's quarters was a literal load off their shoulders . \
As the door shut behind them , Effie wasted no time in undoing her buckles and restraints that held her armor to her .  Hector watched lovingly as Effie stripped off her armor , the true shape of her body slowly being revealed to him .  Following in her footsteps , Hector wasted not time either in getting his armor to the ground until he was in nothing but his under clothes , to which Effie stripped down to as well .  Their eyes gazed over one another , their hearts racing as the impressive physiques of the both of them became clear .  To no surprise , Hector found Effie rather busty beneath all of her armor , with her thighs and arms toned to utter perfection .  It was like gazing upon a bold feminine statue carved out of broze .  Effie as well noticed Hector's muscular frame , every flinch and flex showing his life long efforts .  She also noticed a considerable amount of scars as well , showing that he had seen more than a few rough battles . \
  "  I'm ready when you are , though , I'm not really good at this kinda stuff .  .  .   "   Effie said , waiting for Hector to move onto his bed .  He then leaned towards Effie , planting an affectionate kiss on her cheek .  He then threw his shirt from his body before sliding ontop of his rather large bed . \
  "  No worries , your hands are strong enough to really work my back , which is rare to find .  Just do your best , I'm sure it'll feel great ,  "   Hector said as Effie slowly crawled ontop of him .  She hestitantly reached down , sliding her hands over each of his many scars that had tattoo'd themselves into his flesh until finally reaching around his shoulders . \
  "  Wondering about the scars ?  "   Hector said as Effie give his shoulders a firm grasp and release .  She found herself having to use her full strength to message out all the knots in his impressive muscles , giving her somewhat of a work out as she began . \
  "  They are like a map , with each destination being another battlefield ,  "   Effie stated , rolling his muscles in her hands and she grasped hard .  Hector made an occasional grunt of discomfort as Effie ironed him out with her strength . \
  "  Good analogy , that's basically what it is .  I've seen many battlefields in my time , and these scars are a firm reminder of how hard I fought to survive ,  "   Hector said as Effie shifted onto his rear to put her weight on the middle of his back . \
  "  I've never seen someone who had seen so much combat and lived to tell about it .  .  . you really are something else Hector ,  "   Effie said softly , Hector grunts of pain causing her to hesitate . \
  "  Those are good grunts , keep going ,  "   Hector replied , helping Effie relax as she continued to move down his body . \
  "  When you become a general in Ostia , is from surviving as many battles as lives lost in war .  I've earned all of these scars like medals of honor to add prestige to my title ,  "   Hector groaned as Effie dug her knuckles into his lower back , forcing pressure onto them to really get into his muscles harder .  They stayed that way for minutes on end , until Hector began to push himself up .  Effie slid off of him as he rose into a sit . \
He then grinned at Effie and took her by the hand , laying onto his back and pulling her ontop of him .  Hector could feel Effie's heart race like a horse , her body now shaking from her nerves and desires .  Effie sat her rear against Hector's crotch , pressing her hands onto his chest as he looked up into her eyes . \
  "  My God , you are absolutely beautiful ,  "   Hector said , caressing her cheek with his hand .  She closed her eyes and held his hand to her face as it grew warmer still . \
  "  I've never been called beautiful before .  .  . it's really strange .  .  .   "   Effie said , releasing his hand .  Hector smirked and shook his headnow running his hands down her arms . \
  "  You have the perfect body Effie ; Strong , beautiful , and fully built .  I can't imagine why any man wouldn't call you beautiful ,  "   Hector said , Effie's face now red from embarassment . \
  "  It's probably because they know I could snap them in half like a twig .  Most men back in Nohr are afraid of a woman with so much muscle ,  "   Effie said , gasping softly as his hands slid down her sides .  Firmly pressing against her while moving his hands , Hector finally made his way to the bottom of her shirt that clung to her tightly from her sweat .  Gently grasping it , Effie looked at him , raising her arms to allow him to remove her shirt off completely .  Effie felt a strange movement under her rear as her body was revealed to Hector , his eyes struggling to find a starting point on her amazing frame . \
  "  Then the men in Nohr are a bunch of pansies that just can't handle a real woman like yourself ,  "   Hector said with a grin , causing Effie to blush heavily once again .  Hector rested his hands upon her rear , slowly sliding them up her sides then eventually gently cupping her breasts . \
  "  These are quite a handful , how do you manage to not have back problems from battling so much ?  "   Hector asked curiously .  Effie then leaned forward , gently grinding her crotch against his as her lips moved within inches of his own . \
  "  You talk to much ,  "   Effie whispered , her chest now smooshed up against his own .  Hector smiled then gently grasped her rear with his hands .  He then gently kissed upon her lips , which grew from meek to savage within minutes .  It was if their talking were merely a seal , waiting to be broken to unleash their urges . \
Moans and groans began to fill the room as their lips fought for dominance , Effie forcefully grinding her body against Hector's as if warming him up in the cold of winter .  Effie leaned forward , giving Hector an invitation to pleasure her chest as she reached behind her , resting her palm over his member that boldly surpassed the waistline of his bottoms .  Hector grasped on her breasts roughly , kissing and licking against them , causing Effie to moan boarishly into the open air .  She began stroking his member through his bottoms , astounded by its sheer mass . \
Effie then sat up right on his stomach , turning to get a better grasp on his bottoms .  The sound of ripping fabric filled Hector's ears as Effie literally tore his bottoms in half at his crotch .  Then then reached down to her own bottoms , shredding them off of her with minimal effort . \
  "  Sorry , they were in the way ,  "   Effie said , now rubbing her moist crevice along Hector sizely member .  Moans left his lips as the warm fluids coated him , his urges rising to unspeakable levels .  Hector wrapped on of his masculine arms around Effie , forcing her lips down to his while using his other hand to lineup is throbbing member with her warm , moist snatch .  Effie then pushed off from him , slamming her crevice down on his length roughly , crying out as he hit all her walls .  Effie began to shake and grip tightly on Hector's chest , letting their bodies become more acquainted . \
  "  You're .  .  . really big .  .  . I-I like it .  .  .   "   Effie winced , smiling at him as his own face grew slightly red . \
  "  And you're really tight .  .  . I like that also ,  "   Hector said with a smirk as he gripped onto to Effie's rear harshly .  Effie cried out passionately as she began to work her hips , moving up his member that her crotch squeezed so tightly then slamming down again , using her full strength .  Hector found himself clenching his body tight as she road his large length harshly . \
  "  G-Good God .  .  . this feels amazing .  .  .   "   Hector grunted , moving his hands to her waist .  He grasped tightly around her sides , now using his own strength to help Effie go harder .  With every yank and fall , Effie began brutishly crying out , helpless to fight the pleasure as her eyes fluttered and her lips quivering with every movement .  The bed that they were on began bashing against the stone walls of his room with every down thrust , cracking the beds posts and frame little by little . \
  "  DON'T STOP , GOD DON'T STOP !  "   Effie yelled , her nails now digging harshly into Hector's chest .  The pain and pleasure being bestowed on him only wanted to make him run wild , pounding her down on him harder and harder until Effie lost control of her voice . \
  "  AH !  "   Effie let out a masculine yell , her body tensing up as she came to a climax .  As Hector continued to thrash into her , Effie began to pant aloud , desperately trying to voice her overwhelming pleasure so that her body wouldn't break .  She gripped onto Hector's body like a vice , now kissing and whining against his lips as loud groans left his throat . \
  "  E-EFFIE !  "   Hector yelled , his hands gaining a death grasp on her waist to slam his length in , its twitching and throbbing resulting in a flood of his seed to burst inside of her .  Effie tried to move her body on him but Hector forcibly restrained her , knowing that he was lose his mind if she kept going .  Their lips aggressively attacked each other , they're tongues and moans still growing between them as they shared their moment of clarity . \
  "  A-Again .  .  . can you go again ?  "   Effie groaned desperately , her arms now grasping around his neck .  He could feel Effie still twitching , shivering and shifting on his shaft as his seed began to ooze from her crevice and down to his pelvis . \
  "  Yeah , I can .  Lay back .  .  .   "   Hector said , catching his breath .  Effie gently kissed him once more , slowly moving off of his still erect member .  She watched his nectar pour from her flooded crevice , blushing heavily as it dripped all over his crotch .  She then laid onto her back , her legs spread out as she regained her breath as well .  He reached down and used his seed that was all over his crotch as a lubricant , stroking his member ever so slightly to prep it for use again .  Crawling over to her , Hector moved her muscular legs over his shoulders to give him a stronger access .  Effie latched her hands behind Hector's neck as she tried to untense her legs so that it wouldn't feel they were being strained .  Hector smiled in her eyes as she shifted stray hairs from her forhead to give it a gentle kiss . \
  "  You really are beautiful ,  "   Hector side , allowing Effie to smile as he shifted his body forward .  Effie groaned and tensed up , her body straining against Hector as he slide his manhood back in , completely filling her soaked and flooded crevice once more .  Without hesitation , Hector moved his body up so that he was now using his weight along with his strength to pound into her .  Effie forced her lips to his as he began smashing his length inside her , her nether lips gripping tightly around it as if forcing him to go harder .  They began to share moans and groans as their lips pressed harshly , each of them letting their sounds echo in their mouths .  Effie's boarish voice groaned and moaned loudly into his lips , forcing his groans to sound from his throat as he thrashed around inside her .  The bed again began to creak loudly , the posts and frame again slamming against the walls of his room . \
  "  Geh ! I'm starting to feel dizzy ,  "   Hector said to himself as he found his body overheating from the pleasure between them .  Effie noticed Hector's eyes beginning to fade in and out a little , realizing that the amount of power he was putting into his thrusts was immense by any man's standards .  She shifted her legs from his shoudlers as she cried out , now harsly grasping behind Hector head .  Clenching his hair tightly , she forced his face into her bossom to rest his eyes as he went .  Hector groaned and growled into her chest as he began kiss wildly between them , causing Effie to grip his hair tighter as he went . \
  "  I-I'm going to break !  "   Effie groaned loudly , letting out a small yelp of pain and pleasure with each thrust .  Hector began yelling into her chest , his member twitch and throbbing wildly inside of her to the point of losing it .  Effie wrapped her legs around his waist as his seed poured inside her once more , the feeling of his fluids mixing with hers causing her to cry out as well .  The two of them found themselves tensed up and panting , their stamina growing thin as they slowed their pace .  Effie released his head , allowing him to move up and kiss her lovingly as he kept his throbbing length inside of her .  The two of them blushed and smiled into each others eyes as they became one , the pleasure overtaking them becoming sweet and blissful .  Although both of them were bears on the battlefield , in the bedroom , they were strong and passionate lovers . \
  "  What did you need to talk about sister , it's not like you to call me to your quarters this late at night ,  "   Palla said , parking her rear next to Catria , whose gaze was cold and lifeless as she stared at the ground . \
  "  It hurts so much Palla .  .  . my heart feels like its constantly being squeezed to death by the crippling hand of jealousy .  .  .   "   Catria said , shaking as a tear formed in the corner of her eyes . \
  "  It's about Lord Marth again , isn't it ?  "   Palla inquired , gently brushing Catria's mid-length sapphire hair with her fingers . \
  "  I .  .  . I can't stop thinking about him ever since I was summoned to this place .  .  . I've been through countless battles now where Lord Marth is on the same field of battle as I .  Never before has he been within physical reach of my hands and arms since he was a Lord , but now he's fighting side by side with me .  Every time he grows so close , my heart races , my feelings grow chaotic and all I want in my heart is to do nothing more than to hold him .  But .  .  .   "   Catria's cold expression stayed but tears began to drip one by one onto her knees as she kept her eyes away from Palla's . \
  "  But he is wed to Lady Caeda .  That's what you're going to say aren't you ?  "   Palla asked but knew the answer .  Catria buried her face in her hands , her voice , stoic and calm to the point where she didn't make a single melancholic gasp while her eyes were screaming in pain . \
  "  I'm a terrible person Palla .  .  . you have no idea the things I would do to make Lord Marth mine .  .  . awful terrible acts that are spawned from the crooked jealousy that resides in my heart .  I try to numb these noxious thoughts and the over abundance of feelings I have by requesting more and more time on the battlefield .  But even that now is crumbling to pieces like a decaying wall holding back a wild stream .  .  .   "   Catria trailed off , trembling from the emotional pain that was relentlessly coursing through her .  Palla simply let out a gentle sigh , moving Catria's gaze from the floor and turning to pull her into a warm embrace .  Catria tried to hold back the reigns of her sadness like she would on her Pegasus , but failed as she began to sob loudly against her loving sister . \
  "  Shh , its OK Catria , its OK .  I'm here for you ,  "   Palla said as she rubbed on Catria's back .  She then began to hum quietly , much like their mother had for many years to help them all rest .  For nearly ten minutes she cried , her face now cascaded in her warm tears and gasping .  Palla then smiled , brushing her fingers through Catria's hair once again . \
  "  You know Catria , I've noticed that a lot of the heroes who have come to this world are from different times in which they lived .  You do remember when Princess Minerva was summoned here for the first time ; she looked at the three of us with confused eyes , as if we had never met in our entire lives .  Maybe Lord Marth could be from an era where he had not fallen in love with Lady Caeda ,  "   Palla said , releasing Catria from her grasp .  Catria began wiping her eyes as her sobbing slowly came to a close before returning her attention to Palla . \
  "  Wouldn't that still make me a bad person , considering I already know what his destiny is to be wed to Lady Ceada ? Besides , hasn't Lord Marth always had feelings for Lady Caeda , even since they were kids ?  "   Catria asked , her cool , calm demeanor steadily returning to her .  Palla smiled and shook her head , reaching over and giving Catria's hand a small squeeze . \
  "  Askr is a strange place without reason or logic .  As magical as it is as everyone unites under one banner , there are still things that can not be explained and can not be helped .  Where there is a Lord Marth that loves and marries Lady Caeda , there must be a Lord Marth at a time to which he didn't love her so strongly .  I know well you do not wish ill of him nor of Lady Caeda , but if this is a Lord Marth where they hadn't fallen in love , then perhaps your feelings can and will be heard .  There's no better time to act than now since Lady Caeda has yet to be summoned .  Take heart , and be strong dear sister ,  "   Palla replied , giving Catria a soft peck on her forehead .  Catria then smiled and returned her eyes to the ground . \
  "  Are you sure you should be supporting me on this ? Don't you feel horrid for wanting me to pull Lord Marth and Lady Caeda apart ?  "   Catria sighed , Palla then rustling the top of her hair lightly . \
  "  You are my younger sister Catria , and you know as well as I do that family always comes first .  Have faith in your feelings and you shall be rewarded ,  "   Palla said , leaving Catria with a warm smile and a tear or two falling down her cheeks again . \
  "  I suggest you get plenty of rest if you plan to confess yourself tomorrow , otherwise you will look awfully dreadful went presenting yourself ,  "   Palla said with a small giggle , rising up from Catria's bed .  Catria took a hefty breath , letting it out in a long , unnerving sigh to steady herself .  As Palla left the room , Catria slowly slid under her covers , blowing out the candle that was lit upon her night stand to her left .  Thinking it over , realizing that her sister could be right , she let out a nervous sigh before turning to lay on her side . \
  "  Is it really right .  .  .  ?  "   Catria said , her emotional overload causing her to drift right off to sleep .  As restless as her soul was , her body happily took advantage of rest , forcing her to stay down and relax her thoughts through the night .  Waking up the next day , she immediately found herself gazing in her mirror ; her hair was a disheveled mess from tossing and turning a bit , her face looked quite rough , the aftermath of her crying was still visible . \
  "  This won't do .  .  .   "   Catria grumbled , grabbing her brush from atop of her dresser .  For a solid hour Catria went over herself , making sure she was presentable as humanly possible for her nervous confession to Lord Marth .  Looking back in the mirror , she grabbed the lengthy , white headband that she always wore into battle , tying it and adjusting it on her hair as a sign of confidence . \
  "  OK , NOW I'm ready ,  "   Catria said with a smile .  The halls of the Askran barracks were blooming with heroes as they readied themselves for the next confrontation .  Fortunately she knew that she and Marth weren't going to be on duty today , which finally gave her the window of opportunity she needed .  Originally she was just going to train with Palla and Est , but she knew Palla would vouch for her so that she could do what she's wanted to for so long . \
Catria found herself strutting around the barracks for some time ; she met with several of her fellow heroes from her time such as Alm , Celica and Minerva as she went on , keeping their conversations to a minimal to keep on going .  Circling back around after an hour of searching , it wasn't til she approached the assignment board that her Lord Marth appeared before her .  Checking the meeting schedules , Marth slowly dragging his finger down the vast list of heroes to find his own . \
  "  Lord Marth ,  "   Catria said , causing Marth to flinch .  Marth quickly turned his gaze to meet the voice who had called to him so abruptly . \
  "  Oh , Catria , good morning ,  "   Marth said , a smile already upon his face .  It was Marth's kindness , consideration , courage and looks that had Catria head over heels .  Whenever she caught sight of Marth's positive vibes , she felt like she could down an armor just for him . \
  "  Good morning .  How are you today ?  "   Catria asked , her demeanor and words growing strict to keep her nerves in check . \
  "  I'm wonderful this morning .  It's another day that I'm alive and another morning of peace for all .  How are you ?  "   Marth replied , causing Catria to blush lightly while maintaining her somewhat serious demeanor . \
  "  I-I'm quite well , thank you for asking .  Why are you checking the board ? You know you're off duty today ,  "   Catria inquired , Marth's attention shifting from the board and back to her . \
  "  A hero is never off duty , only on standby .  I always check every morning just encase there are changes .  I like to always be prepared ,  "   Marth said with a delightful spring in his voice .  Catria found herself moving her hands behind her back , clenching them together as she tried to maintain eye contact . \
  "  I see .  .  . that's very admirable of you .  I .  .  . um .  .  . I was wondering .  .  .   "   Catria's words began to fumble , her face growing warmer as she tried her best to get her words out into the open . \
  "  Yes , Catria ?  "   Marth said , giving her his full attention .  Catria's eyes began shifting to the side , then to his , then back to the side again , repeating the cycle twice as she tried to formulate her feelings into words . \
  "  I-I really like .  .  . being at your side , Lord Marth .  In every battle that we have fought as allies , I never feel scared or worried as long as you are there .  The strong bond we have made through kinship really means a lot to me .  .  . so I .  .  . um .  .  .   "   Catria's heart began to race at a wild pace , her chest practically shifting with every heartbeat .  The red in her face grew out of control as she tried her all to get her words out .  Marth frowned and approached her , gently cupping her cheeks with his hands . \
  "  H-He's touching me !  "   Catria said to herself as Marth's eyes closed in on hers .  She began to sweat , her nerves running around while she kept her composure .  She shut her eyes as he moved in , only to feel his forehead pressed against hers . \
  "  I'm checking to see if you are feverish , you seem to be red and sweating a bit ,  "   Marth said hopefully .  Catria's heart continued to race as Marth continued to inspect her closely . \
  "  I-I'm find Lord Marth , you needn't get so close to my unworthy self to your touch ,  "   Catria said , stiffening up like a statue as Marth moved away to gaze over her . \
  "  We are equals here in this world Catria , there's no need to feel unworthy .  To be honest , I feel the same as you ; when we're on the battlefield , knowing that you are such a capable soldier , it puts me at ease .  It's because I know that my concerns can be shifted more towards the battle and less upon my allies since my heart always defaults to protecting others .  So I would like to think you for that ,  "   Marth said , his warm smile melting Catria's heart and soul to mush .  Catria swallowed nervously , trying everything in her power to stay calm . \
  "  I'm glad to know that , Lord Marth .  I always do my best to assure others that I am capable on my own .  But , there is one another thing that I feel as a result of those battles that I feel I have to tell you ,  "   Catria said , clenching her fists together as she finally felt the courage to get to the point . \
  "  Oh ? What is that ?  "   Marth asked curiously .  Just as Catria was about to let her heart's feelings come flying out , a loud explosion shook the air just outside of the barracks walls .  Both Catria and Marth jumped to attention , Catria's nerves being but on standby as her heart and soul went into high alert . \
  "  I had a poor feeling that this morning wouldn't stay too peaceful , but like I said , a hero is never off duty ,  "   Marth said with a grin , charging off in the direction of the blast .  Catria immediately to flight with her running , quickly catching up to Marth then adjusting her pace to match his .  As if the red sea were closing its passage , warriors began flooding in behind the two of them , everyone catching the high alert . \
  "  Lord Marth .  I'll take a left up at the next section to grab my pegasus and spear .  I'll meet you on the front lines ,  "   Catria said , a slight smile on her face . \
  "  Make haste , judging from the magnitude of that explosion , it seems we may have a full scale battle ahead of us .  I'll be waiting at the front for you , so be safe ,  "   Marth replied with a grin as they branched off from one another .  Outside the barracks walls , Bruno was leading a full scale assault with a small army of cavalry units , which meant he was going to try and break his way through . \
Without any time to prepare , only a handful of heroes could make it outside with the rest being quickly re-routed to the various parts of the barracks for defensive purposes .  Leading the charge Marth ran out into the field , with the cries of Catria's Pegasus calling over head .  Marth unsheathed his Falchion and aimed to towards the enemy . \
  "  Let us vanquish this evil ! All units , forward !  "   Marth cried out .  Normally Kiran would be the one to direct orders , but he was unable to make it out into the fray due to the sheer numbers of heroes crowding through .  Catria dove down to hover just above Marth to watch over him and herself .  The battle raged on for a good amount of time , the yells of clashing metal and and the screams of magic disrupted the air violently .  Marth and Catria made their way through , carefully taking out foes that would be crucial to their overall forces .  As Marth attempted to attack Bruno head on , unaware of two mages that were hidden in his blind spot . \
  "  MARTH LOOK OUT !  "   Catria shouted , pulling the reigns on her Pegasus to go into a dive bomb .  Marth's eyes caught the bright light of magic being hurled at him , gritting his teeth as he went to guard .  Catria cried out as she cut down the one to his left , swinging her hand out to him .  Marth immediately grasped a hold of her hand , allowing her to drag him out of harms way before dropping him off next to the second mage , which he immediately cut down .  Catria grinned victoriously but failed to watch Bruno's actions as well .  Marth tried to warn Catria of Bruno's assault , but it was too late .  He watched as Catria pulled up the reigns , only to have her Pegasus badly hurt from the magic which sent her flying off from 50 feet in the air . \
  "  CATRIA !  "   Marth shouted , immediately running along Catria's trajectory as fast as he could .  Catria could do nothing shake in pain , her very thoughts being that of disaster . \
  "  Damn it .  .  . I never got to tell Marth how I feel .  .  .   "   Catria grunted in pain , feeling the force of the wind pick up beneath her .  She clenched her eyes tight in fear but instead felt the surprising embrace of arms wrapping around her and a hard yet comfortable surface that kept her from harms way . \
  "  GEH !  "   Marth grunted as Catria knocked him off his feet upon grasping .  He could feel Catria shaking in fear in his arms , her muscles as tight as her eyes were shut .  She heard a familiar sigh of relief then opened her eyes to look down at her savior .  Her face turned blood red as she looked in his eyes , a pained smile on his face with one eye shut . \
  "  Are you alright , Catria ?  "   Marth asked , coughing as moved Catria to the ground .  Catria's eyes began filling with tears as she took in the stunning turn of events that she had just experienced . \
  "  Y-Yes .  .  . thank you Lord Marth .  .  .   "   Catria said , trying to get up .  She yelp and winced in pain as she rose to a knee , which prompted Marth to help her lay back down . \
  "  Stay down Catria .  The battle is almost over so just lay still , I'll come back for you ,  "   Marth said , his warm , loving smile warming Catria's heart once again . \
  "  Be safe , Lord Marth ,  "   Catria said before rolling onto her back .  She stared up at the cloudy skies above ; it was if she had just fallen from heaven and saved from the death of the fall .  The cool air helped to chill her cheeks , which were now set a blaze from being in her loves arms .  The rest of the fight was smooth sailing , making Bruno's retreat eminent .  As the few heroes shouted in victory , Marth took the initiative to immediately head back over to Catria , just as he had promised .  Slowing down his pace , he sheathed his Falchion before kneeling down next Catria . \
  "  Catria , are you OK to .  .  .   "   Marth's words were stolen as he was taken by surprise .  Catria could no longer fight back the feelings that plagued her heart and mind , causing her to wrap her arms behind Marth's neck to pull his worn out lips to her anxious ones .  Marth tried to pull back , but Catria held onto him tighter , refusing to let go of the feeling of bliss that well'd up in her heart .  Marth then slowly shut his eyes , taking in the moment until Catria nervously pulled away . \
  "  I-I'm sorry Lord Marth .  .  . I know that isn't a proper thing to do , especially right now .  .  . I .  .  . I don't even know how you feel about me .  .  .   "   Catria sighed heavily , averting her eyes shamefully as she also took in the glory of her efforts .  Marth sighed and smiled , helping her up onto her feet .  He then pulled her arm behind his neck and on his shoulders to help her move onward . \
  "  Don't worry about it , we can talk more when we get back the barracks , OK ?  "   Marth said , his cheeks a little rosy as well .  Catria put all of her efforts into moving carefully not to strain Marth , several healers now tending to her Pegasus and herself as they approached the entrance to the barracks .  Marth held her in place until the healers were done , which then allowed her to stand on her own with no problems at all . \
  "  All better now , don't worry , we'll take good care of your Pegasus til its back to full strength ,  "   Genny said with a smile . \
  "  I'm counting on you ,  "   Catria replied , now moving and walking at Marth's side .  The both of them were now on route to report the results of the battle to Commander Anna , who had been redirecting everyone this whole time to take into account that it may be a full scale war on their hands .  Catria couldn't look Marth in the eyes after what she had done , almost too ashamed to even stand near him due to her bold actions .  As she was beginning to pull away , she gazed in surprise as Marth snatched her hand up with his , now holding onto it as they made their way to the Order of Heroes hall .  Catria decided it was best not to say a word , and simply enjoy the small token of affection that Marth had bestowed upon her . \
The results briefing was rather short due to its smooth handling .  Both Marth and Catria along with the 5 other heroes were commended for their quick actions and praised highly for their courage .  In this moment , Catria felt that she was now worthy of Marth , seeing that she was decorated in the battle as much as he was .  Upon leaving , yet again , Catria paused , smiling at Marth as she bowed respectfully . \
  "  Thank you , Lord Marth .  Without you I wouldn't be alive right now .  I've been nothing but a hassle for you so I'll be happy to take my leave .  I hope we can be in a battle together again ,  "   Catria said hastily , trying to escape the awkward situation that she felt she had created .  As Catria tried to pull away , Marth grabbed her hand once more , this time smiling in her eyes . \
  "  It was nothing more than my duty Catria .  However , we do need to discuss what happened out there between us .  Come with me please ,  "   Marth said , sincerity in his voice instead of dismay , which pleasantly surprised Catria to say the least .  She couldn't help but nervously gaze at him as they walked , to which he replied with a kind smile and an affectionate squeeze of her hand .  Her body began to catch fire , realizing that she was being led to his personal quarters , which were a slight bit larger than her own . \
  "  Please , come inside ,  "   Marth said , opening the door and holding it open for her to enter .  Just as she expected , the room was nothing short of immaculate ; everything was in perfect order with everything bronze and silver being polished to perfection .  Unlike her room , he actually had a small table with two chairs , its surface covered in book and parchment from studying so diligently about something or another .  Marth pulled out Catria's chair like a gentleman , swaying his hand to prompt her to sit .  Catria continued to blush as she gave him a nod , slowly sliding herself onto it so that Marth could walk around and sit across from her . \
  "  You're displeased with me , aren't you Lord Marth ?  "   Catria said , lowering her head and hiding her eyes .  Marth sighed softly , sliding his studying material to the sides of the table so that he could see her clearly . \
  "  Catria , please look at me ,  "   Marth said politely , causing Catria to immediately return her eyes to his , which were smiling back at her .  She raised her arms onto the table , sprawling one of them forward in dismay .  Marth gently moved his hand over hers , holding it in his warm grasp as his eyes gazed directly into hers . \
  "  You have nothing to be ashamed of in sharing your feelings for me .  You , yourself , are quite an extroadinary person ; You always battle with all of your heart and soul , although quiet , you always have concern for others and try to help them , and of course , you've done nothing but treat me as if I were more valuable than life itself ,  "   Marth said , giving her hand a small squeeze .  Catria sighed , her eyes still gazing over his as her smile turned neutral . \
  "  I only do what comes naturally to me Lord Marth .  Nothing more , and nothing less ,  "   Catria replied , still sitting as if cast in stone .  Marth slowly raised Catria's hand into the air , standing up out of his seat lean forward .  He closed his eyes and tilted his head down , gently pressing his lips to the top of her hand .  Catria was speechless as she gazed on at the scene , unable to believe it as it transpired . \
  "  And that is why I too have fallen in love with you Catria ,  "   Marth said .  Catria's eyes began to water with joy as she smiled at him , unable to process the joy in which she felt , like ocean waves crashing against a wall of stones .  Her humble and sincere nature wouldn't allow for such feelings to come so easily , convincing herself that she didn't deserve that which she has been yearning for . \
  "  I .  .  . um .  .  . I-I'm not worthy of such affection Lord Marth .  .  . I mean .  .  . you're royalty and I'm just a soldier , s-surely you must think you could do better than me .  .  .   "   Catria said , trying yet again to put Marth before herself .  She wanted him more than anything , this is the situation she longed for for so long , and yet , she still felt guilty knowing what his true future was .  Marth smiled and shook his head , slowly returning his gaze to her . \
  "  Love and valor don't just favor those of nobility , its the passion and strength of the heart that truly determines their value .  You have these things in full abundance , and I for one wish to indulge and share them with you ,  "   Marth said , now walking around the table towards Catria .  Catria could no longer hold back her feelings inside .  She had tried to push him away , she tried to convince herself that she wasn't worthy of him , yet here she was , with Marth being the one to take her breath away .  Catria rose to her feet as Marth came around , her face completely flushed as he took her hand .  He then slowly led her over to his bed , sitting her down on its comforting support before turning away . \
  "  Pardon me , this armor is suitable for this situation ,  "   Marth said with a small laugh , unlatching his restraints to remove his main pieces .  Catria couldn't help but to stare at Marth as he slowly stripped his armor down one piece at a time .  First his capes restraints , then his guards , all the way to his boots , removed everything until he was in nothing but his shorts undergarments .  Catria was very impressed by his toned physique , nothing less than what she expected from him .  He then turned to her , his smile still wide as he moved up on her . \
  "  Would you like some help removing yours ?  "   Marth said , laughing softly as she stood up .  She then turned her back to him , dropping her arms to her sides before peeking over her shoulder . \
  "  I-I would .  Some of those places are hard to reach ,  "   Catria said , clearly spouting nonsense through her teeth .  Marth took it at base value , helping her remove her restraints one at a time .  She could help to gasp and sigh as Marth's hands move all over her , helping remove her shell so that he could partake in its core .  Once she was in nothing more than her undergarments , she turned back around to gaze in his eyes helplessly as he rested his arms around her waist . \
  "  Lord Marth .  .  . I .  .  . I'm happy beyond words that you feel this way for me .  .  . I promise not to let you down ,  "   Catria's words fumbled over one another , causing Marth to softly chuckle as she continued her flustered attempts to communicate . \
  "  Please , just call me Marth ,  "   Marth replied , he slowly leaned forward , pressing his forehead against her as he did earlier as Catria smiled back . \
  "  Thank you , Marth ,  "   she replied .  Marth's hands then crawled up her back as his lips seized hers in a sudden burst of passion , catching her off guard with his approach .  She lovingly returned the affection , wrapping her arms around him as well .  Time stood still as they stood there , their lips and tongues dancing with one another in a feverish passion .  Marth then slowly laid Catria on her back on top of his bed , throwing his shirt off before looming over her .  Kiss after kiss , Marth began planting them all over Catria . \
Starting at her neck , he slowly removed her shirt and bra , gently grasping onto her breasts before kissing and licking over them .  Catria wrapped her arms around his head , eventually leaving her with just her hands on it as he moved down further .  Kissing down to below her belly button , she then instinctively spread her legs , allowing Marth to slowly slide her underwear down her thighs and off her ankles .  He then raised up slightly to gaze all over her , her hands instinctively covering her chest out of embarrassment . \
  "  You're even more beautiful than I thought Catria , I'm very lucky that you love me as you do ,  "   Marth said before lowering back down .  Catria began repetitively gliding her hands through Marth's silky locks of hair as he gently kissed against each of her inner thighs , until finally his lips met with her warm , potent crotch .  Gently kissing against her nether lips , he then slid his tongue through his lips , gently smooshing it into her nether region .  Catria let out a sudden high pitch yelp , gasping in its aftermath as she gently grasped Marth's hair . \
  "  This is a dream .  .  . t-this can't be real ,  "   Catria said to herself , leaning up to get a better view .  Catria simply gazed through her hazy , love sick eyes at Marth as he lovingly pleasured her nether region , gliding his tongue around inside before moving a few fingers inside .  She began to gasp and moan helpless , her eyes glued to him as they grew half closed from passion .  Marth used his wrists to separate her legs further , holding her moist snatch up with his fingers to that he could dig his tongue deeper inside . \
Catria found herself throwing her head back onto the bed , both of her hands and pressed against the back of Marth's head without thought or restraint .  Marth began to moan and groan into her , causing her heart to pound inside her chest vigorously as he continued his oral assault .  Her legs began twitched and trembling the faster and deeper he went , her moans turning into high pitched whines as her grasp on his hair grew tighter . \
  "  M-M-MARTH .  .  .   "   she whined , nearly screaming as she forced his lips into her moist pit of aroused passion , her legs clenching around his neck as she came to a climax .  She trembled and tensed up , still holding him tightly until finally it subsided .  Realizing what she had just , she covered her mouth in embarrassment as Marth stood up . \
  "  I'm so sorry ! I didn't mean to do that to you ,  "   Catria said , her words falling short with Marth's smile and a small chuckle .  He used the back of his hand to wipe his lips before sliding up next to her .  She sat up to look him in the face as she removed her hand from her mouth . \
  "  I'm glad you felt good , it doesn't matter how rough it gets ,  "   Marth said , kissing her lips softly .  As they continued to let their lips press to each other , Catria slid her hand down , curiously sliding it over the growing bulge in Marth's underwear , gently gripping it with a few fingers before slowly stroking it .  Marth moaned and groaned against Catria's lips , causing a smile to form upon her face .  Taking the initiative , she began to tease Marth's neck with the tip of her tongue , causing him to lightly gasp as she helped him remove his bottoms . \
  "  You sound really cute like that ,  "   Catria said with a small giggle .  Marth's face went red , smiling wide as Catria slowly moved onto the floor .  She gently nestled her cheek against the side of his full erect manhood , moving it up and down playfully as she gazed up at him . \
  "  Now its my turn to make you feel good , right ?  "   Catria said , gazing up at Marth as her hand gently gripped around the base of it . \
  "  Please .  .  . I would like that ,  "   Marth said , brushing Catria's bangs from her eyes .  He held her hair from her face as she slid out her tongue , dragging it all the way up his full length and smothering the head with its full surface .  Marth began breathing heavily , his hand desperate to keep Catria's hair out of the way so he could watch every second of her loving touch .  She dragged her lips and down the side of it over and over again , moistening it with her saliva as she jerked him off from the base .  Gazing up in his eyes playfully , she smiled as she smothered her tongue all the way up his curve , gently kissing the head of his member lovingly . \
  "  Y-you're really good at this ,  "   Marth moaned , Catria blushing heavily and smiling as she kisses the tip once more , taking more into her mouth than the last . \
  "  Thank you Lord .  .  . I mean , Marth .  I'm just doing what comes naturally to me ,  "   Catria said lovingly as she raised her head up .  Slowly , she began pinching the head of his member with her lips , squeezing it as she moved it into her mouth .  Little by little , Marth watched as the head of his member was forcibly squeezed all the way between her lips , her tongue sloshing against it over and over again in her mouth . \
He gripped a hold of her bangs as he moaned out , flattening his hand to pin them aside .  She slightly tilted her head , allowing Marth to watch as slid more and more of it into her mouth , her tongue cushioning it as it went in .  With every single moan from Marth's lips , her red face grew hotter and her nether region became thicker with its juices , overwhelming joy from hearing her lovers passionate cries .  She then slowly moved her mouth back up then down again , slowly pumping her mouth up and down his now moist shaft lovingly .  With each shift , Marth began to moan out soundly , grasping onto to the side of head gently , still holding her bangs out of the way to watch the display of pure lust . \
  "  C-Catria .  .  . I .  .  . I can't take much more .  .  .   "   Marth gasped , now swaying his hips with her mouth .  Catria then grasped the base of his member again , now stroking with her mouth's shifting .  His hip's swaying turned into thrusting as he started running his hands through her hair , keeping the hair from her eyes as he gently pressed down with each shift of her mouth and hand .  Catria then enclosed the head of his member between her lips , thrashing her tongue all over the tip as she stroked him faster and faster . \
  "  I-I'm gonna cum !  "   Marth cried as a warning , immediately covering his mouth and crying into it helplessly as she stroked harder .  He then growled and shouted into his mouth , Catria humming affectionately as his cum began pouring into her mouth .  He stared desperately at her , his cheeks flushed as he removed his hand from her head . \
He grunted and gasped with each load of his seed that expelled , finally relaxing once he finished .  Catria continued to keep a grasp on his member as she slowly swallowed each spurt , removing her mouth once it was all down .  She giggled as she wiped her mouth , playfully flicking the tip of his member with her tongue before moving up . \
  "  I'm glad you felt good , I tried my best for you ,  "   Catria said , wiping her mouth then moving up next to Marth .  Marth slowly moved her so that her back was against the sheets , resting her head against a pillow as Marth moved over top of her .  He shifted her hair to the side once again , gently planting a kiss on her forehead before pressing his to hers . \
  "  I love you , Catria ,  "   Marth said quietly , gently pecking her lips with his .  He then moved his hands down to adjust Catria's lower body , slowly leaning forward to press the head of his still erect member against her moist crotch .  Catria gasped , reaching down to gently grasp around his member to line it up with her hole . \
I love you too , Marth ,  "   Catria whispered , gently tugging on Marth to make sure he was in the right area .  Marth then slid his hips forward , causing Catria to moan out and make a slight face of pain as his manhood his all her walls .  Catria trembled as her nether lips began to throb , his size stretching her to the point where her nether region clasped around his . \
  "  Are you alright Catria ?  "   Marth said , caressing her pained expression until it mellowed out . \
  "  Y-yeah , I'm fine .  You're just a little bigger down there than I thought you'd be ,  "   Catria groaned , a smile forming her lips as she became comfortable with the sensation .  Taking a sigh of relief , Catria reached for his hands , locking her fingers with his in loving holds before kissing his lips . \
  "  You can move now ,  "   Catria insured .  Marth then began to shift deeper inside , keeping it held there as her hands grasped onto his tightly .  Slowly , he began to pull out until only the head of his member stayed in .  Gripping her hands , he then thrust back in , causing her to moan out loud .  Their faces blushed at one another as Marth pinned Catria's hands to the sides of her head , moaning soundly as he returned his lips to her . \
The bed began to shaking as Marth slowly made his way in and out of Catria , their lips parting to breath and pant aloud .  The two of them were now locked into one another , all of their thoughts melding into a single thought as Marth began to go faster .  With every loud moan that they shared , their hands clenched closer together , until their lust began to cry into the night .  Catria latched her arms behind Marth's neck , savagely smooshing her lips into his while Marth held her sides , thrusting harder and harder without restraint . \
Their moans turns into yells and screams of passion , their lips muting each other periodically to keep themselves from waking up the rooms to either side of his .  Catria began to tremble violently , now screaming into his mouth as she tensed her entire body around his .  Her climax sloshed around his member , causing him to lose himself as well . \
  "  C-CATRIA !  "   Marth cried out loudly , Catria forcing his lips back against hers as his seed poured into her .  Her tight grasp around him made Marth feel as if his whole world was perfect , grasping onto her as passionately as he filled Catria to the brim with his juices .  Panting loudly , covered in sweat , the two lovers gazed into each others eyes , as if it were the only thing they wished to see the rest of their lives .  All of Catria's guilt had been shattered into dust , allowing her to truly enjoy the bliss that she longed for .  Marth brushed his hands through the sides of Catria's hair , again pressing his forehead to hers before smiling wide . \
  "  And with this , I give myself to you Catria .  In sickness and in health , I will remain by your side ,  "   he said , giving her lips another soft kiss . \
  "  And I will follow you to the ends of the Earth , and be your sword and shield for any battles that come ahead ,  "   Catria said with a light giggle .  It was a warm spring afternoon mid-April and Phoenix was doing a difficult job with two of his good friends .  He is fairly stressed that Larry volunteered to make the cake and do all the decorating , but luckily he has a strong man at his side . \
  "  Well Nick , how does it feel to have another grown up in your house ?  "   The bigger gentleman asks . \
  "  I don't know Gumshoe .  I don't think she'll act any more grown up than she formerly was .   "   Phoenix responds as he points to a large bed frame .    "  Are you ready to help me move this bed ?  "   Dick gets on the back side and grips the bottom . \
  "  You bet pal !  "   They collect all their strength and lift the bed up from the bottom .  Phoenix grunts upon carrying it .    "  Is it heavy ?  "   The detective asks . \
  "  A little .   "   The attorney responds whilst gritting his teeth .  They finally straighten it out so the end touches the wall .  Phoenix begins panting once the bed frame is finally dropped . \
  "  Are you alright pal ?  "   Gumshoe asks .  Phoenix nods . \
  "  I think , so .   "   He says as he continues breathing .    "  I can't believe Maya wants a room makeover for her birthday .   "   Gumshoe shrugs . \
  "  You and I are men .  We don't know for sure why women want things so organized .  But we're the strong one's who are there to please those women .   "   Phoenix rolls his eyes . \
  "  I guess so .   "   Gumshoe begins laughing . \
  "  It's mighty lucky of you to have a woman in your life !  "   He remarks .  The defense attorney frowns lightly . \
  "  Maya's not my girlfriend Dick .   "   The large detective shrugs . \
  "  I don't know Nick .  She seems pretty happy whenever you're around .   "   The lawyer shrugs . \
  "  Probably because I'm the only one she has .  She lost her family you know ?  "   Gumshoe smirks . \
  "  So you're conceding you're like family to her ?  "   Phoenix gives an embarrassed look . \
  "  No , no .  Not at all\'85 Well ,  "   He regains his cool .    "  She's just like a little sister to me .   "   Gumshoe chuckles . \
  "  Does she see you as an older brother ?  "   He nods . \
  "  Of course .  I'm Mia Fey's apprentice and so I'm sure I just look like a brother to her .   "   The detective shrugs . \
  "  Alright pal .  I believe you .   "   He picks up some pink princess posters .    "  And where should we put these ?  "   Phoenix points at the wall . \
  "  Anywhere on the wall should do .   "   He turns around and heads for the door . \
  "  Wait pal , where are you going ?  "   Gumshoe asks .  Phoenix turns around . \
  "  I'm going to see how they're doing .   "   He steps out of the bedroom . \
\
In the kitchen , his good friend Larry Butz and Maya's little cousin Pearl are setting decorations everywhere .  Pearl is blowing up balloons and Larry is hanging streamers .  They both face Phoenix as he steps out . \
  "  Nicky ! How's the room beautification going ?  "   Larry asks .  Phoenix shrugs . \
  "  Not too bad .  But I still can't believe Maya didn't ask for a normal present like a giant inflatable Steel Samurai or even a trip to Berry Big Circus .   "   Pearl giggles . \
  "  You're so funny Mr .  Nick .   "   She says joyfully .    "  You could make her birthday present a free defense case or a bailout if she screws up .   "   Phoenix rolls his eyes . \
  "  I've defended Maya twice now and I can't afford to bail her out again .   "   He declares .    "  It's a good thing Edgeworth was there to pay it forward or we would've been screwed in that case .   "   Larry chuckles . \
  "  Edgy is a real generous guy isn't he ?  "   Pearl frowns . \
  "  I don't know about that .  He almost won that case with the Nickel Samurai guy and got her killed by that killer man !  "   She says with some visible anger .  Phoenix holds his hands out in defense . \
  "  He was only doing his job .  You wouldn't actually want the wrong person in prison would you ?  "   Pearl rolls her eyes . \
  "  As long as Mystic Maya isn't harmed , I don't care what happens .   "   Larry gives a joyful grimace . \
  "  By the way Nick ! Pearl is a real sweet girl .   "   Pearl blushes . \
  "  Awe aren't you a nice man ?  "   Larry blushes too . \
  "  So um , maybe you'll let her stay at my house tonight ?  "   Phoenix gives a shocked look .  He knows Larry is not a pedophile , but this is still something he'd consider unexpected . \
  "  Well\'85 I don't know .  Pearl isn't used to hanging out with adults and-  "  \
  "  So what if I'm not used to it ? !  "   She interrupts .    "  You've never had a slumber party before ?  "   Phoenix pauses . \
  "  Of course we have .   "   Larry says .    "  Nicky used to come over to my house all the time when we were kids .  And I spent nights at his house , it was a lot of fun !  "   Phoenix gives a cold sweat . \
*Why did you have to encourage her Larry ?* He thinks .  Pearl gives him puppy eyes . \
  "  Please Mr .  Nick ? Can I go home with Larry for the night ?  "   Phoenix sighs . \
  "  Alright you can .   "   He mumbles . \
  "  Yay !  "   Pearl squeals . \
  "  Yes !  "   Larry exclaims .    "  High five Pearly !  "   They hit hands .  Another cold sweat reaches the attorney's hair . \
*I guess it's just Maya and I tonight . * He thinks . \
  "  By the way , how about that large bed you got for her ?  "   Larry asks . \
  "  It's so comfortable !  "   Pearl squeals .  Phoenix rolls his eyes . \
  "  It cost me a lot of money .  It's not something most people buy as a birthday present .   "   Larry gives him a thumbs up . \
  "  That just means you really love her !  "   The lawyer sighs . \
  "  I guess .   "   He faces the room .    "  I've got to finish decorating before they get back .   "   He walks back into the room . \
  "  Okay ! Have fun !  "   Pearl shouts to him . \
\
About two hours later the decorations are done and the bedroom is in the best quality shape it could be .  Phoenix and Gumshoe glance over the glamorous bedroom and the detective gives a large grin . \
  "  Well , we did a pretty good job huh Nick ?  "   The lawyer nods . \
  "  I guess so .  But do you think she'll like it ?  "   Gumshoe raises an eyebrow . \
  "  Are you kidding me pal ? This room is fancier than any room I'll ever be able to afford .  And that mattress is fit for a king !  "   Phoenix sighs deeply . \
  "  I suppose you're right .   "   The detective's smile vanishes once he sees the look on Phoenix's face . \
  "  Whoa pal , is something wrong ?  "   Phoenix closes his eyes and shakes his head lightly . \
  "  It's nothing sir .  I'm perfectly happy .   "   Gumshoe steps forward . \
  "  Come on pal , tell me .   "   He says in a concerned tone .    "  If there's a problem , I won't judge you .   "   Phoenix faces him with a stressed look . \
  "  This bed was so damn expensive for someone with my net worth to afford .  What bothers me is , I let Maya have this bedroom so she feels comfortable .  But the truth is , I'm the one who buys this expensive bed for someone else , and then has to fall asleep on the couch at the end of the night .   "   Gumshoe gives a sympathetic sigh . \
  "  Wow that's rough .   "   He looks at the enormous bed once more .    "  That must've costed you some big bucks .   "   The attorney nods . \
  "  It costs about seventy percent of the cash I've made in one year .  I have to pay bills , rent , insurance , and food for three now that Pearl's living with us .  And believe me , Maya eats a lot of burgers for someone of her size .   "   Gumshoe chuckles lightly . \
  "  She's so lucky .  All I ever get to eat are instant noodles .   "   Phoenix shrugs . \
  "  At least I'm not the one paying your salary .  Edgeworth is way more fortunate than I am .   "   Gumshoe pushes his shoulder forward .    "  Hey !  "  \
  "  Cheer up pal .  It's Maya's birthday ! All that matters is this gift makes her happy don't you think ?  "   Phoenix pauses for a second and then regains his charisma . \
  "  You're right Gumshoe .  If she's happy , I'm happy .   "   He admits as they step into the living room .  Larry and Pearl look poised . \
  "  Hey Nicky , Edgy just texted me .  They're almost here !  "   Both men flinch . \
  "  Already ?  "   Gumshoe asks as Larry nods . \
  "  He couldn't stall her anymore .   "   Pearl makes a gesture with her hands . \
  "  Hide ! I hear them coming !  "   Phoenix flips the light off and both of them hide behind the counter .  A few moments later , Edgeworth opens the door and holds it open . \
  "  After you Madame .   "   He charmingly says as Maya steps inside . \
  "  Thank you Edgeworth .   "   She flips the light on .    "  Now where-  "  \
  "  SURPRISE !  "   Maya flinches as Phoenix , Gumshoe , Larry , and Pearl jump out from behind the counter .    "  HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAYA !  "   They all shout .  Maya stands there in shock for a moment before glancing to Edgeworth . \
  "  Happy birthday Maya .   "   He says with a charming smile as she turns back to everyone else . \
  "  Guys\'85  "   She mumbles as joyful tears come to her eyes .    "  You did this for me ?  "   Dick gives her a charming grin . \
  "  Of course we did pal !  "   He exclaims as he points at Phoenix .    "  It was all Nick's idea !  "   Maya's smile widens lightly as more joyful tears approach . \
  "  Really Nick ?  "   Phoenix smiles proudly . \
  "  It was my plan .   "   He looks at Larry and Pearl .    "  Larry made the cake , and Pearl set up the decorations .   "   Larry chuckles . \
  "  Nicky paid for everything on his own .   "   Maya gasps lightly . \
  "  Really ?  "   She asks . \
  "  It's true Maya .   "   Edgeworth says .    "  Phoenix wanted everyone's help to prepare this , but he insisted none of us throw a single cent into the cost of this event .   "   Maya gasps in happiness . \
  "  Awe Nick ! You're so sweet !  "   Phoenix blushes lightly . \
  "  You're welcome Maya .  It was my pleasure .   "   Gumshoe grabs a knife . \
  "  Well , what are we waiting for ? Let's eat this cake !  "   Larry , Pearl , and Maya all raise their fists in the air . \
  "  YEAH !  "   They scream .  As they prepare that , Phoenix faces his childhood friend . \
  "  Thanks Edgeworth .  I couldn't have done it without you .   "   Edgeworth shrugs humbly . \
  "  No need to thank me Phoenix .  You deserve it .   "   He points at their friends .    "  Look how happy she is .   "   Maya happily accepts a piece of cake and Pearl hands her a fork . \
  "  Thanks Pearl .   "   She says . \
  "  Doesn't she deserve this ?  "   Edgeworth asks .  Phoenix nods . \
  "  I sure think so .  But you did me a huge favor occupying her .   "   The prosecutor gives his humble smile . \
  "  Always my pleasure Mr .  Wright .   "  \
\
For the next few hours they all have fun , tell each other stories and have conversations .  After they eat dinner and watch a couple episodes of the Steel Samurai , Larry looks at his watch . \
  "  Whoa ! It's already nine o' clock ? !  "   Maya gasps . \
  "  It is ? ! Already ?  "   She panics .  Phoenix rolls his eyes . \
  "  What , do spirit mediums have bedtimes ?  "   She gives an embarrassed frown . \
  "  No , it's just\'85 I had plans .   "   Gumshoe grins . \
  "  Well , I guess the party is over for now !  "   Phoenix holds his hands out . \
  "  Wait , you don't need to leave right this minute !  "   Edgeworth gives a sharp , mysterious smirk . \
  "  As a matter of fact we should .   "   Pearl and Maya hug . \
  "  I'll see you tomorrow Mystic Maya .   "   Pearl says . \
  "  I'll look forward to it cousin Pearly .   "   She responds as Gumshoe walks out the door . \
  "  Bye everyone ! See you around !  "   Larry and Pearl follow him . \
  "  Bye Nicky , bye Edgy , bye Maya !  "   Larry waves as he steps out .  Pearl waves as well . \
  "  Goodnight everyone !  "   She closes the door behind them .  Maya turns the T . V .  off and gets up . \
  "  I guess I should get ready for bed now .   "   She says adamantly as she enters her new room .  Edgeworth stands up and opens the door . \
  "  I should probably head out as well .   "   He steps outside .  Phoenix gets up and follows him . \
  "  Wait a minute Edgeworth !  "   Miles stops as the opposite attorney steps outside . \
  "  What is it now Phoenix ?  "   He asks as he faces him .  Phoenix gives a sincere smile . \
  "  I just wanted to say thank you again .  Maya's so lucky to have us isn't she ?  "   Edgeworth chuckles subtly . \
  "  Mr .  Wright , I can already assure you , you're the lucky one .   "   Phoenix's smile fades . \
  "  How so ?  "   Edgeworth does his humble gesture . \
  "  You have so many friends who love and adore you .  But even the gentlemen as charming and well-groomed as me don't always have a girl in their life .   "   Phoenix sighs .    "  You on the other hand , you're the successful man here , not me .   "  \
  "  Edgeworth , I told detective Gumshoe the exact same thing earlier .   "   He gives the prosecutor an adamant look .    "  I'm not Maya's boyfriend .   "   Edgeworth raises his left eyebrow . \
  "  Oh really ?  "   He shrugs again .    "  A romantic relationship isn't something everyone has even if they try to start one , but I can personally declare with no shame , Maya spent all morning talking about you and how great you are .   "  \
  "  That doesn't mean she's in love with me .   "   Phoenix remarks .  Edgeworth chuckles mischievously . \
  "  I see .  You're so stubborn that you subtly object to the things others around you seem to notice .   "   Phoenix glares . \
  "  Hey , what's that supposed to mean ?  "   He asks with annoyance .  Edgeworth smirks tauntingly . \
  "  It's a mystery you'll take into your dreams .   "   He gets in his car .    "  Have a nice night Mr .  Wright .   "   Phoenix frowns as Edgeworth drives out of his parking lot . \
  "  What has he been up to these days ?  "   He thinks as he turns back to Wright and Co .  Law Offices . \
\
He steps back inside and sighs deeply .  The streamers and balloons are still all over his walls and ceiling .  He feels he's gonna have a tiring time taking them all down , but nonetheless , he might as well do it now because he may not have time if another case happens any time soon . \
  "  Well , another night and another mess I'm left to clean .   "   He grabs a trash bag from below his sink and prepares it .  Suddenly he hears someone . \
  "  Hey Nick , could you come here for a second ?  "   He sighs lightly . \
  "  Can you wait a minute Maya ? I'm trying to clean up the after party .   "  \
  "  That sounds like a stressful task .   "   She says from the bedroom . \
  "  It probably will be .  But luckily I'm used to stressful tasks .   "   He drops a couple used paper plates into the bag . \
  "  Nick ! Please come here .  I have something to show you !  "   She says more assertively .  The lawyer sighs and sets the bag on the floor . \
  "  Maya , what have you got to show me ? I don't remember anyone buying you any presents .   "   He says firmly . \
  "  Just come inside the room !  "   She yells .  He rolls his eyes . \
  "  Maya , I've already seen the room .  Hell , I'm the one who purchased that over-sized comfortable mattress .   "   He frowns at the door .    "  And yet you're the one sleeping on it .   "   Maya's frustration strings are being yanked . \
  "  I'm sorry Mr .  Bossy .  Did you want me to sleep on the couch tonight ? I'll switch rooms with you .   "   Phoenix's frown vanishes . \
  "  I don't care about the bed .  I'm just really tired right now and it's your birthday , so you should enjoy your sleep in that bed .   "   He turns around .    "  So on that note , please be quiet .   "   Maya sighs deeply , audible enough for him to hear through the door . \
  "  Phoenix ,  "   She says in a far less enthusiastic voice .    "  Will you please come in here ? I've been looking forward to this all day .   "   The attorney stops for a second .  Maya never calls him by his real name .  Ever since they met , she's been calling him Nick . \
  "  Maya , please\'85  "   He grabs the door knob .    "  What do you want ?  "   He asks with some subtle sadness under his breath . \
  "  What I want more than anything else , is for you to come in this room right now .  Please ?  "   She says very sincerely .  Phoenix exhales again and opens the door . \
  "  Alright Maya ,  "   He enters the room and faces her .    "  Whoa !  "   He flinches and a shocked look locks onto his face .  His strange and adorable friend is lying on the bed , completely naked .  The moment his small pupils manage to make eye contact with hers , he notices she's blushing deeply .  Phoenix's face immediately turns bright pink .    "  Maya ! What are you doing ? !  "   He interjects .  The young spirit medium's facial expression changes into a coy smile . \
  "  I'm eighteen now aren't I ?  "   The lawyer nods as he begins sweating .    "  You know what that means right ?  "  \
  "  No .   "   He mumbles .  His eyes widen and his body temperature increases as she slowly rises onto her knees .  He has a tough time keeping his eyes off her well-developed breasts . \
  "  I'm legal now .   "   She says as he almost faints . \
  "  That's\'85  "   He begins seeing a silhouette around the edges of his vision , but her unique breasts are still perfectly visible to him .  She's still blushing fairly brightly herself , but nowhere near as much as he is .  She steps off the bed and slowly steps right before him . \
  "  Phoenix\'85  "   She says gently .    "  This is all I want for my birthday .   "   Phoenix finally snaps out of his daze . \
  "  Okay hold it !  "   He covers his eyes .    "  Ever since this morning , all you've wanted for your birthday was sex ?  "   Maya glances to her left . \
  "  It's a very weird request , but\'85  "   She looks into his eyes as he uncovers them .    "  Yes Nick .  I'm a legal adult now and I desperately want to have sex .   "  \
  "  But\'85 you're six and a half years younger than me !  "   He exclaims as she blushes again . \
  "  I know , but you're a very good looking man .  You have such a charming face and such a strong body .   "   Phoenix smiles lightly . \
  "  Thanks Maya , but I never knew you had this sort of plan .  Is this only to lose your virginity ?  "   She shakes her head . \
  "  Of course not .   "   She gently touches his arm .  He can feel his heart pounding madly within his chest .    "  If I just wanted to have sex , I could've asked Edgeworth\'85 or Larry .   "   Phoenix holds his hand out blatantly . \
  "  Please don't give me those images !  "   He demands .    "  That's creeping me out .   "   Maya sighs . \
  "  My point is , I think many people want sex , but nobody wants it with just anyone .   "   She faces him again with an innocent look .    "  But everyone tries to look for the right person .   "   She throws her arms around his neck .    "  To me , you're the right person Phoenix .  As Pearl would say ; you're my special guy .   "   The defense attorney tries to find an objection , but her attractive appearance and her soothing yet seductive voice is fogging his brain . \
  "  Well Maya\'85  "   Phoenix is sweating deeply .    "  I don't know .   "   Maya gives him a gloomy look . \
  "  Really Nick .  You won't help me meet the thing I desire more than anything else ?  "   He frowns lightly . \
  "  Maya , sex isn't a very healthy thing to desire .   "   She shakes her head . \
  "  Nick , it's not sex I desire .  It's only one time with the boy I hold closest to my heart .   "   He's fairly surprised to hear this .    "  I want it to be fun .   "   Phoenix suddenly remembers one thing . \
  "  Look Maya , I always thought of you as a little sister .   "   She gives a disappointed frown . \
  "  Oh , I see .  You think this will feel like incest don't you .   "   He shrugs . \
  "  Well , not necessarily .  But what would your sister say ?  "   Maya flinches . \
  "  She's not here to decide for us now is she ?  "   Phoenix sighs . \
  "  I don't think Mia would be happy with either of us if we did this .   "   Maya glares with determination . \
  "  Well then , there's only one way to find out .   "   She holds her hands together and leans forward .  Phoenix's pupils shrink as the rest of his eyes expand . \
  "  No ! Don't channel her now !  "   Maya ignores him completely , a second later Mia appears and Phoenix quickly turns around .    "  AH !  "   He shuts his eyes as the slightly older lady chuckles . \
  "  What is going on with you crazy kids ?  "   She asks as Phoenix begins shivering on the ground . \
  "  I'm so sorry Mia ! This wasn't my plan at all !  "   Mia looks down at her bare chest for a second . \
  "  I see Maya didn't care about showing her body to you\'85 or mine for that matter .   "   She says as she blushes lightly . \
  "  I'm not looking Mia .   "   Phoenix reminds her .    "  Just give me the evidence I'm looking for .   "   She raises an eyebrow . \
  "  What evidence ?  "  \
  "  The words ; you do not have my permission to shag my little sister .   "   She chuckles a few times . \
  "  Shag you say ?  "   Phoenix nervously gets up and lightly opens his eyes . \
  "  I used the word 'shag' because I didn't want to say fuck .   "   Mia folds her arms . \
  "  I see .  And I take it you don't want to 'fuck' my sister .   "   Phoenix flinches once she hears her say it . \
  "  Mia , you're not objecting to that idea ?  "   His deceased friend shakes her head . \
  "  Phoenix , I know for a fact Maya loves you and I can tell you have a lot of love for her too .  Can't you see it ?  "   Phoenix faces her and manages to avoid staring at her breasts . \
  "  You're okay with it ?  "   Mia smiles and gives him her approving look . \
  "  Of course I'm okay with it Phoenix .  You're very gentle and very loving , and I've seen both of you go out of your way to protect the other .   "   Phoenix smiles proudly . \
  "  Really chief ? You think so ?  "   Mia chuckles . \
  "  I'm not your chief anymore Phoenix .  I'm merely a victim of a former crime .   "   Phoenix lowers his head lightly in sadness .    "  But I've seen you stand your ground in some of the toughest situations to protect her .  And Phoenix ,  "   She places her hand below his chin and raises his head so they make eye contact .    "  That is something I'll forever be grateful for .  A debt I'll never be able to repay .   "   Phoenix sheds a single tear . \
  "  Mia ?  "   The former defense attorney smiles beautifully . \
  "  You have my consent to engage with my sister .  I know you truly love her and I want you to be there for her .   "   She flinches as Phoenix abruptly wraps his arms around her and pulls them together . \
  "  Okay Mia , I'll do exactly as you say .  I'll be there for her no matter what .   "   Mia chuckles . \
  "  That's a promise you were already fighting to keep before you met me again .   "   She gives him a light kiss on the cheek .    "  Goodbye Phoenix .   "   He lets go of her and stares at her .  Despite his former attempts to avoid staring at her alluring breasts , his eyes concede on him this time .  He pays no attention to her face as he stares at Mia's beautiful breasts , waiting for them to change their shape and size .  By the time her spirit has fled , he's still staring . \
  "  Um\'85 Nick ?  "   Phoenix flinches as he hears her voice .  He lightly raises his visionary angle to her adorable face .  She's blushing lightly .    "  Do you like the way my boobs look ?  "   She mumbles lightly as he mentally snaps out of his daze . \
  "  I'm sorry for staring .  But\'85 you're body has grown .   "   Maya giggles . \
  "  Has it really ?  "   He nods . \
  "  I literally didn't see any size differences between your breasts and Mia's .   "   Maya gives a daring grin . \
  "  Awe , you naughty lawyer .  You've been perving on me and my sister ?  "   Phoenix rubs the side of his neck nervously . \
  "  I'm afraid yes , I'm guilty .   "   Maya chuckles . \
  "  Well then , I think it's only fair I give you your punishment .   "   She winks .    "  If that's alright with you that is .   "   Phoenix finally stops blushing . \
  "  Okay you win .  Mia gave me your blessing .   "   Maya jumps back on the large mattress and opens up the covers . \
  "  Well then Nicky , care to join me ?  "   The attorney steps by the bed . \
  "  I have no objections .   "   He unbuckles his belt .    "  Ergo I concede this case .   "   Maya holds her hand out . \
  "  Hold it !  "   He stops and faces her .    "  I'd like you to get naked very slowly .   "   Phoenix blushes and redoes his buckle . \
  "  Alright then , how should I do this ?  "   He asks .  She gives a seductive grin . \
  "  Let's keep one thing straight , I'm in charge .  This punishment will be about you giving me the pleasure I'm looking for .   "   He shrugs and sits on the bed . \
  "  Okay , can I at least take my shoes off ?  "   She nods . \
  "  Shoes and socks for now .  The rest will come later .   "   As he removes his shoes , she says something surprising .    "  And you , will cum later .   "   He flinches once again , but he decides not to question her and takes off his socks anyway . \
  "  Okay Mystic Maya ,  "   He faces her with his charming grin .    "  I'm ready for my spirit training .   "   The spirit medium seductively raises her right eyebrow . \
  "  I like your attitude .  But if we want to enjoy this , we need to make sure both of us are comfortable throughout this night .   "   Phoenix chuckles . \
  "  I think it'd be easier if I removed my clothes .   "   She giggles . \
  "  It'll get easier for you .  But the relief is what will stimulate your hormones .  You'll feel truly amazing when it's over .   "   He smiles coyly . \
  "  Okay then , how should I start ?  "   Maya giggles . \
  "  I see you've taken a peculiar look at my boobs most men don't do .   "   He chuckles . \
  "  That's because you don't wear a bra .   "   She rolls her eyes . \
  "  Bras are so indescribably uncomfortable .  You're a man so you wouldn't understand .   "   He flinches as she rolls her eyes again .    "  However , if you truly like the shape of my breasts , don't wait or make any hesitations .  Just go for it !  "   Phoenix feels his testicles straightening out in his pants . \
  "  You want me to massage your breasts ?  "   She winks cutely . \
  "  Phoenix , if you failed to get me off the hook both times , I almost guarantee someone in the prison would've raped me by now .  You can do whatever the hell you like !  "   She exclaims happily as the proud attorney rolls up his sleeves . \
  "  Alright then , here we go .   "   Phoenix gently buries his fingers below the edges of her breasts and immediately she squeals quietly , yet rather high pitched , even for her .  The charming lawyer squeezes her bosoms and begins rubbing them all around .  After about twenty seconds , Maya decides to speak up . \
  "  You're very good at this Nick .  Are you sure you've never had sex before ?  "   The lawyer pauses and gives her an amusing grimace . \
  "  Perhaps you've forgotten who I am .  I'm a defense attorney .  I don't tell lies to anyone .   "   Maya chuckles . \
  "  Understandable , now what are you thinking about right now ?  "   Phoenix thinks for a few seconds . \
  "  I think you have very soft skin .   "   He admits .    "  Aside from that , I love the shape your chest has .   "   Maya gives an unusually seductive look . \
  "  Well , I love the shape you have as well Feenie .   "   The attorney immediately flinches .  Maya's pleasured look fades instantly .    "  What's wrong ? Did I overwhelm you by calling you Feenie ?  "   Phoenix sighs and shamefully turns away . \
  "  No Maya , I just\'85  "   He faces her again .    "  You reminded me of someone I was in love with when I was younger .   "   She gives him a sympathetic frown . \
  "  Oh , I'm sorry .   "   She says as the lawyer begins crying subtly .    "  Nick , what's wrong ?  "   He sighs lightly . \
  "  It's nothing really\'85  "   He mumbles as Maya grabs his right sleeve .    "  What are you doing now ?  "   He asks as she pulls his blue sleeve off of his arm . \
  "  You really need comforting .  Please take off your shirt now .   "   She says in a quiet , yet soothing tone .  Phoenix shrugs and takes off his jacket , followed by his white shirt and red tie .  Maya gives him a hopeful smile .    "  Do you feel more comfortable now ?  "   She asks cutely .  He sighs again . \
  "  I guess so .   "   He suddenly flinches as the smaller girl embraces him completely .  She wraps her arms around his back and pulls them together .  Upon regaining his emotions , he hugs her back . \
  "  Nick , I'm so sorry that happened to you .   "   The defense attorney smiles lightly . \
  "  It's alright Maya .  I'm okay now .   "   She stops hugging him and stares at his still sorrowful face . \
  "  You're not over her yet ?  "   Phoenix sighs . \
  "  I'd be lying if I told you I am .   "   Maya sheds a tear of her own .  But with all of her courage , she goes for his face .  Phoenix flinches and his eyes widen once their lips are pressed against one another's .  He glances at Maya's pair of closed eyes for a second and his eyelids drop .  He wraps his arms around her neck and shamelessly concedes to kiss her back .  Both of them sit there with their chests touching and their lips locked for a few solid minutes .  Maya's warm body was making his own more comfortable , but there is yet one thing that's keeping him from full comfort , his pants .  After she finally ends the kiss she stares into his eyes . \
  "  Are you over it yet ?  "   The attorney gives a faithful smile . \
  "  I am now .   "   He squeezes her lightly .    "  I love you Maya .   "   She squeezes him back and he tries to hide a painful grunt . \
  "  I love you to Phoenix .   "   She stops to stare at his face .  Her concerned expression comes back when she spots his irritated eyebrows .    "  Are you okay ?  "   He nods nervously .    "  You look discomforted .   "   She says nervously .  Phoenix opens his eyes and blushes brightly . \
  "  You're sitting on my crotch .   "   Maya looks down and feels something thicken beneath her cervix . \
  "  Oh my !  "   She quickly lifts herself off of him and sits back down in front of him .    "  Did I hurt you ? !  "   She exclaims fearfully .  Phoenix opens his right eye and his brow twitches repeatedly . \
  "  No , it's a little sore but I'm a tough guy .   "   Maya gives him a seductive gloomy look . \
  "  I think your hard evidence needs to be revealed to the judge now .   "   He blushes deeper and unbuckles his belt . \
  "  Yes , your honor .   "   He removes his pants and Maya's face puckers itself once she sees the outline within his underwear . \
  "  Wow Phoenix ! You must be really excited right now !  "   She exclaims as he chuckles nervously . \
  "  I guess I couldn't hide this from you forever .   "   Maya glances at him . \
  "  I'm ready for you to show it to me .   "   Phoenix closes his eyes and grabs the edge of his underwear . \
  "  Alright .   "   He smoothly pulls his underwear down and his eight and a half inch cock flings upward once the elastic releases it .  Maya stares at his raging erection for a few seconds . \
  "  Wow ! It's even larger than I'd imagined it would be !  "   She exclaims loudly as he slowly opens his eyes and glances at hers . \
  "  Is that a problem Maya ?  "   Her enthusiastic smile reappears on her face as she faces him . \
  "  Nick , I just want to shove this thing down my throat ! May I please ?  "   Phoenix chuckles and lays down against a pillow . \
  "  You can do whatever you'd like sweetie .   "   He says charmingly .  She squeals loudly . \
  "  Oh thank you !  "   She gets on her knees and leans over his spread legs .  She lifts his scrotum with her left hand , grips his cock with her right , and wraps her warm and tender lips around it .  Phoenix sits back as his close girlfriend moves her mouth up and down over his raging erection .  Under the exhausting pleasure , he can't help but moan quietly . \
  "  Mmm .   "   He hums lightly .    "  That feels so good .   "   Maya's breathing gets heavier , but she doesn't seem bothered . \
  "  Feels , good , for , me , too .   "   She says between pumps .  Eventually , Phoenix feels a very strange feeling within his testicles . \
  "  Maya .   "   He says somewhat worryingly .  She stops and looks up at him . \
  "  Yes Feenie ?  "   The lawyer blushes greatly . \
  "  I feel close to ejaculating .   "   The spirit medium smiles cutely . \
  "  Well then , I think it's time for us to do this together .   "   She lets go of his cock .    "  Are you thinking what I'm thinking ?  "   She asks extremely seductively .  Phoenix nervous rubs his neck . \
  "  Do you think we should get a condom first ?  "   Maya gives him a daring grin . \
  "  Condoms are too uncomfortable .   "   She stands above him and spreads her legs out .    "  Are you okay with that ?  "   Phoenix nods nervously .    "  Okay great !  "   Maya lowers her bottom slowly and his dick slips into her vagina .  Phoenix shivers lightly at the sudden weight on him , but in a strange way , it feels amazing so he has no objections . \
  "  HMM !  "   Phoenix hums loudly as he grabs Maya's arms and she drops onto him .  She quickly bounces off , and then drops back down . \
  "  This , feels , so , great Nick !  "   She exclaims as she pants between each bounce .  Both of them are very warm and very exhausted , but nonetheless , neither of them are giving up .  After about thirty seconds of thrusting powerfully , Phoenix gathers all of his strength . \
  "  Maya ! I'm gonna cum !  "   He shouts as Maya suddenly begins thrusting faster . \
  "  Hit me with your best shot !  "   She shouts back as he suddenly holds in his breath painfully . \
  "  ERRAAAGH !  "   He grunts loudly as about a half of a pint of semen erupts from his cock inside of her body .  They both continue taking deep breaths as Maya slips off of him and then lays on his left . \
After about three minutes they're both well recovered and regaining their strength .  Maya stares into his dark blue eyes as he stares into her bright blue ones .  Both of them smile happily for a few seconds and then Maya snuggles up to his chest . \
  "  I love you Nick .   "  \
  "  I love you too Maya .   "   She lays her ear on his chest and listens to his strong heartbeat .  A heart she knows beats for her .  Within one minute , she's already sound asleep .  Phoenix leans down and kisses her on top of her head .  After that he wraps his warm arm over her and embraces her lightly .  After a couple of minutes , he yawns deeply . \
  "  Happy birthday Maya .   "   He says before shutting his eyes and joining her in the dream world .   "  Hang on ! I'll be there in a minute  "   I yell as I get off of my couch .  I get up to go check and see who is knocking on my door .  I look through the little peep hole .  It was my best friend Jordyn . \
  "  What are you doing here ?  "   I ask her . \
  "  What I can't just stop by ?  "   she says to me . \
  "  Well it would be nice if I knew that you were coming over ?  "   I say giving a slight chuckle closing the door behind her . \
  "  So what are you doing anyway  "   she asks me . \
  "  Well you know the usual .  Playing the game  "   I said . \
  "  What game  "   she asks as we walk into the living room . \
  "  The game I am constantly on  "   I say giving her this look . \
She looks at me confused .    "  Oh my god .  Seriously ! We have been best friends for how long now ?  "   I say .  I will admit that it did hurt my feelings a little bit .  I mean Jordyn has never really paid any attention to me . \
She just stares at me with a look of confusion on her face . \
I point to the game console .    "  The Legend of Zelda  "   I say to her . \
She rolls her eyes .    "  Oh , that game .  Isn't that where you play as Zelda and stuff ?  "  \
I just stare at her .  Not batting an eye .    "  Really ? No .  First of all you play as Link and you go save Princess Zelda  "   . \
  "  Then why is it called the Legend of Zelda  "   she asks me as acting as if I am dumbfounded . \
I roll my eyes at her .    "  You know you can be real stupid at times  "   I start off with .  She gasps at me . \
  "  Its called the Legend of Zelda because Zelda is reincarnated as the Goddess Hylia and generation after generation a new Zelda is born .  And Link always has to go rescue her  "   I explain . \
  "  Sounds lame  "   she says as she plops herself down on the couch . \
  "  Well if you don't mind , I will finish my task at hand  "   I say sitting beside her . \
  "  Go ahead I would love to watch  "   she says sarcastically . \
I pick up the Nintendo 64 controller and resume my game . \
  "  So what is your task now ?  "   she asks me . \
  "  Well the Zoras are froze under the ice because Ganondorf released at evil spirit in the Water Temple  "   I explain . \
  "  Oh okay  "   she says sounding lost . \
I make my way to Zora's Domain .  I bring out my Ocarina and play Zelda's Lullaby .  I will say that it is such a peaceful song .  I wait for the waterfall to lighten up and I jump inside the hole of darkness . \
  "  You know something ?  "   I say to her . \
  "  Whats that ?  "   she says back . \
  "  I would love to live in a world like that  "  \
  "  Like what ?  "   She questions . \
  "  Like Hyrule  "   I said . \
  "  You know you are such a geek  "   she says laughing .  She gives me a little push .  I laugh back . \
  "  Hey do you mind if I stay the night ?  "   she asks me . \
  "  Yea of course ? Why ?  "   I question . \
  "  Well my parents aren't getting along and I don't feel like hearing them argue  "   she tells me .  I knew Jordyn had a hard life growing up .  She stayed at my house more than she stayed at hers . \
  "  Well my parents aren't coming home in like a week anyway  "   I say still playing the game . \
  "  Why ?  "  \
  "  They went on that cruise remember  "   I say . \
  "  Oh yea .  Aren't they the lucky ones  "   she says rolling her eyes . \
I yawn   "  Well im going to go take a nap .  So ill see you in a little bit  "   I say saving my game .  She justs gives me a smile . \
  "  Ill be right here  "   she tells me . \
I make my way upstairs to my bedroom .  How cool would it be to actually live in Hyrule .  I close my bedroom door and go get in my bed .  I pull the sheets up over my shoulders and fall into a deep sleep . \
Screaming .  Screaming was all I heard .  Was that Jordyn ? I thought .  I open my eyes and sure it enough , there was Jordyn .  We were falling and surrounded by darkness .  I look down and see some sort of light .  As we come closer to the light I make out what it is .  Water .  Why are we falling to water ? I take in a deep breath .  I feel the water stinging against my skin like a needle ripping through fabric .  As soon as I hit the water , I immediately start swimming forward .  I gasp for air when I rise from the surface . \
I swim to shore .  I pull up on the bank .  Jordyn swims towards me .  I reach out my hand and she grabs onto me .  I pull her up to shore . \
  "  Where are we ?  "   she asks . \
I look around .  Over to the right , there was a fishery .  To my left there was a house .  Wait that wasn't a house .  That was the lab .  I gasp .  I look at Jordyn . \
  "  Were in Hyrule  "   I say to her . \
My name is Beth .  I am a 20 year old Zelda nerd covered in Hylian water .  This has to be a dream come true .  I am here to tell you the story of my Fate in Hyrule . \
A/N : Hey guys I know short chapter .  I did it a little weird saying the main characters name last .  But I have a lot of cool ideas that I hope you are looking forward to .  Anyway I hope you enjoy this story and let me know what you think about it . \
  "  Were in Hyrule  "   I say to her . \
  "  Hyrule ?  "   she says with a funny look on her face . \
I sigh   "  Do you ever pay attention to anything I say .  Hyrule .  The land where Zelda and Link live  "   . \
She burst out laughing .    "  You can't be serious .  This is a joke  "   . \
  "  Yea , well you think that this is funny .  Jump back in the water right there  "   I say pointing to the edge of the land   "  and look down .  I guarantee you , that there will be a gates entrance  "   . \
Sure enough Jordyn jumped into the water and swam down .  I peeked over the edge to watch her .  Jordyn emerges from the water . \
  "  How did you know that ?  "   she says concerned . \
  "  I told you  "   I say crossing my arms   "  we are in Hyrule  "   . \
I help her out of the water .    "  Okay , so if we are here now  "   I begin   "  Then where is Link ? How far has he gotten in his quest ?  "  \
  "  You are really taking this whole 'Hyrule' mess seriously huh ?  "   she says . \
I roll my eyes .    "  Will you just trust me ?  "  \
She let out a huff of air and nodded .  We walked down the bridge to head to Hyrule field .  I nearly jumped off the bridge when I heard Jordyn scream . \
I slap her on her arm .    "  What is wrong with you ?  "  \
She does not say a word , she just points up into the sky .  Guays . \
I grab hold of her wrist .    "  Would you come on ? They're Guays .  If you keep walking they won't notice you  "   I say to her . \
We proceed with our walking .  We stop whenever we reach the lab . \
  "  This land of Hyrule is scary  "   she says to me . \
  "  Not if you know what you are doing  "   I say to her .    "  Alright let's go  "   .  We make a move for it .  We run towards Hyrule field .  As we are running , I yell back at Jordyn . \
  "  Alright Jordyn , up ahead , there are going to be these jumping things .  They are called Tektites .  Just run past them .  We don't have anything to kill them with  "   I say . \
  "  Okay  "   she yells back .  Then the time was there .  The Tektites had spotted us .  We run right past them .  Jordyn barely missed one .  We run towards Hyrule field . \
Once we get there , I stop .  I had to catch my breath .    "  Alright  "   I say catching my breath .    "  We have to\'85find out\'85 if Link has .  . got into the Sacred Realm  "   I tell her . \
  "  Why ?  "   she asks hunched over .  We weren't in the best of shape . \
  "  Because if Link has unlocked the Sacred Realm then he is an adult and that means that Ganondorf rules Hyrule .  And that's not good  "   I say . \
  "  Wait .  Ganondorf is the evil one with the red hair right ?  "   I couldn't believe it .  She actually knew something about Zelda . \
  "  Yea  "   I say cheerfully . \
She pokes me with a grin .    "  Didn't you always have a crush on him ?  "   she says to me . \
I can feel my face turn red .    "  Did not  "   I say lying through my teeth . \
  "  Did to  "   she starts back . \
  "  Okay , anyway we have to find out if Link is still a child of an adult  "   . \
  "  And how do we do that ?  "   she asks me .  I stand up and walk towards Lon Lon ranch .  Well the back of it anyway . \
  "  Beth what are you doing ?  "   Jordyn whispers loudly at me . \
  "  If Link is a child then there are these flying things with sharp edges .  They are called Peahats  "   I explain again . \
  "  And if he isn't ?  "  \
  "  Then they won't be there  "   I tell her getting aggravated .  I know she knows nothing of the game , but jeez put two and two together . \
  "  Well let's hope they aren't there  "   she says to me . \
I walk a little closer .  Sure enough they aren't there .  I get excited .  That mean Link can save us and we won't be in danger .  I motion for Jordyn to come up here with me .  After a couple of seconds , without hearing any footsteps , I look back .  No one is there . \
  "  Jordyn ?  "   I say .    "  Jordyn ?  "  \
I heard something coming to my right .  I go to look .  I couldn't see who it was .  I blacked out .  Whoever it was hit me in the head . \
I wake up to someone screaming , again . \
  "  Let me out of here !  "   a familiar voice says .  Jordyn . \
I go to sit up , but I have it excruciating migraine .  I guess she hears me stirring . \
  "  Oh my gosh , Beth are you okay ?  "   she asks me . \
  "  Yea I'm fine  "   I say holding my head .  I look around the room .  I should have known .  The Gerudo Fortress . \
  "  Are you okay ? What happened ?  "   I ask her . \
  "  Well I was watching you and all of a sudden I blacked out .  Someone hit me  "   she explains . \
  "  Well who hit you , they are called Gerudo's .  They are Ganondorf's thieves I guess you would say .  They are a tribe and a race that is bound to extinct .  In Twilight Princess there are no Gerudo's .  They are very powerful and sneaky women  "   I explain to her . \
She just looks at me with a blank expression .    "  Anyway , we have to get out of here  "   I say . \
  "  And how exactly do you plan on doing that ?  "   she said cockily . \
  "  Well in the game , you would use the hookshot .  It would grab onto that wooden part right there  "   I say pointing   "  But you will have to help me up there .  But we will wait until it gets dark  "   . \
She nods .  We go lay down and doze off to sleep .  I mean we do have a big mission coming up . \
I wake up .  The only light outside is the moonlight .  I wake Jordyn up . \
  "  You ready ?  "   I ask her . \
She yawns and gives me a thumbs up .  I help her up and let her get awake .  After what seemed like forever , it was time .  Jordyn lays her hands over one another and places her back against the wall for support .  I place my right foot in her hands .  She gives me a boost .  I grab ahold of the ledge . \
  "  Okay push me up  "   I say .  She give me another boost .  I swing one leg over .  My stomach turns when I look down .  That was a long drop . \
  "  Hey good thing we did cheerleading  "   she says with a laugh . \
  "  This is no time for jokes  "   I say sternly .  I reach my hand down and pull her up . \
  "  I think I'm going to throw up  "   she says looking down . \
  "  It's not that bad .  Trust me .  Just let go  "   I say to her . \
I turn around and let go .  It was a little painful fall though .  I motion for Jordyn to come down .  She turns around and drops . \
  "  Follow me  "   I whisper quietly .  We head straight ahead and then make a left around the rock .  It was a straight path from here .  We start walking . \
My heart stops when I hear one of them yell . \
  "  They have escaped !  "   the guard yells .  Well just our luck , we were right by the stairs .  The guard looks down . \
  "  They are right here  "   she yells . \
  "  Run !  "   I scream .  Jordyn and I ran .  We ran like our lives depended on it .  Literally they did .  I could hear the guards' feet right behind us .  As we approach the bridge , my stomach dropped .  The bridge was out . \
  "  What do we do ?  "   she asked frantically . \
  "  Do you trust me ?  "   I say . \
  "  Yea ? Why ?  "  \
  "  Because this river leads to Lake Hylia  "   I explain . \
  "  You want to jump !  "   she yells at me in confusion .  The guards were about to grab us .  I grabbed her hand and jumped . \
We scream the whole way down .  I could feel the water engulfing us .  We floated downstream towards Lake Hylia again , barely missing the Octorok . \
We come to Lake Hylia again .  I knew that they were going to be searching for us now . \
  "  What were those things ?  "   Jordyn asks me . \
  "  What ?  "   I asked not knowing what she meant . \
  "  Those things shooting at us  "  \
  "  Oh those are Octorok's  "   I didn't feel like going into any description so I just left it at that . \
  "  We have to leave here  "   I say to her . \
  "  Why can't we stay here ?  "   she asks . \
  "  Well for one , they will be checking here .  Two , because its night and we need to move  "   . \
We grab ahold of shore and make our way back to Hyrule Field .  When we reach Hyrule Field , instead of going left , we went right .  We walked down the dirt paths .  I was taking it all in .  I was still in disbelief .  Over the hill , I saw the Castle .  The drawbridge was broken .  The flames burned out .  I knew Volvagia had awoken because Death Mountain had the red ring above it .  We walk up to the broken drawbridge . \
  "  It's a shame  "   I say putting my head down . \
  "  What ?  "   she asks me . \
  "  That this town used to be so cheerful and happy .  Now its fill with dead  "   I say sorrowfully . \
  "  There's dead people in there !  "   she gasps .  I wasn't in the mood to be Navi .  I just sit on the stone ledge that was on both sided of the entrance .  I look out .  It was so peaceful at night .  I look to my left .  I wanted to explore everywhere .  As I close my eyes , something caught them .  I look down .  I gasp as my hand covers my mouth . \
  "  What ?  "   Jordyn asked me . \
I get up .  I was excited but heartbroken . \
  "  The Ocarina of Time  "   . \
A/N : okay so Beth and Jordyn have found the ocarina .  What will happen next ? Will Ganondorf appear ? Will Beth have to be the one to save Hyrule ? Anyway hey leave me some awesome ideas and I will defiantly use them in my story ! Thanks for the viewers and leave a review please !\
I could not believe it .  The Ocarina of Time was right in front of me .  I jump down into the moat and grab it .  There it was , in my hands .  Tears filled my eyes .  It was a dream come true .  Jordyn reaches her hand towards me .  I grab her hand and she pulls me up . \
  "  So whats that ?  "   she asked me . \
I rolled my eyes .    "  Did you not just hear what I said ? It's the Ocarina of Time  "   . \
  "  Ohhh ? Well what does it do ?  "   she questioned me . \
  "  Well for one it opens the Door of Time .  It also holds a great value for the quest line , which leads me to wonder .  Is Link alive ?  "   I say to myself .  To be sure he wouldn't just leave it here . \
  "  Let's walk to Kakariko Village since its right here to get a good night's rest  "   I say to Jordyn . \
  "  Where is that at ?  "   she asked me . \
I pointed to our left .    "  Its right up those steps .  Also while we are there , we can ask around if anyone knows where Link is  "   . \
We make our way to Kakariko Village .  We walk over the bridge and head towards the steps .  As I place my foot on the first step , I turn around .  Was that a horse I heard ? I wondered .  My heart lit up like a Christmas tree .  Link .  I turn around .  My face turned white as a ghost .  Sure enough it was a horse , but it wasn't Link . \
  "  No  "   the words slid out of my mouth . \
  "  What ?  "   Jordyn said . \
  "  Ganondorf  "   I said in a very low tone . \
He was looking at us .  Dead at us .  All I could do was stare back .  Why was I getting nervous ? I knew his weakness .  I guess it was just the gaze he pierced through me with .  I tap Jordyn on the arm .  We quickly make our way to Kakariko .  I knew he watched us the whole time . \
Once we get inside the Village , I breathe a sigh of relief .  It was just like the game .  The windmill was straight ahead .  The tall watch tower to the left .  We walk up slowly .  My eyes were fixated on everything . \
  "  We need to go up there  "   I said pointing to a hosue . \
  "  Why that house ?  "   she asked me . \
  "  Just trust me  "   I say with a grin .  Something lit up in me .  I just knew the Hero was alive .  We walk up to the house .  I knock on the door .  A woman answers . \
  "  Hello , my name is Beth , and this is my friend Jordyn .  I was wondering if we could come in .  I have a few questions I would like to ask  "   I say to this woman . \
I know she is wondering what I am doing here because she is looking at me like I am crazy .  She steps aside and we walk in . \
  "  So , I was wondering if you knew that the Hero of Time was alive  "   I say .  The womans eyes got huge . \
  "  Who are you ?  "   she demanded . \
  "  If I told you , you wouldn't believe us .  And to save your breath I will answer the next question you were about to ask .  I came here personally this house , because this house used to be one of the Sheikah's house .  Impa  "   I state to her . \
  "  Yes , but I don't see how this belongs to me ?  "   she asked with confusion . \
I sigh in aggravation .    "  What is it with dumb people ? I just asked , do you know if the Hero of Time is alive .  I just need a yes or no  "   I say as if I am explaining something to a child . \
She closes her eyes and looks down at the floor .  She opens her mouth and replies   "  No  "   . \
My heart dropped .  My body filled with sorrow .    "  How ? I mean why ?  "   I say trying not to cry .  Jordyn came up to me and placed her hand on my shoulder . \
The woman replies   "  It is said , that when Ganondorf took over the Castle , Impa rescued Zelda out of his way .  They left on a white horse with Ganondorf in pursuit .  Although they got away , Ganondorf stopped by Link .  Link drew his sword and Ganondorf slaughtered him right there where he stood .  He didn't even give him a chance  "   she said with tears rolling down her face .    "  He was just a boy  "   she wept . \
  "  What about the Ocarina ?  "   I ask . \
  "  No one knows .  They say Zelda threw it at Link when they escaped , but no one has retrieved it of found its where abouts  "   she says drying her eyes . \
  "  Well I just want to say thank you for letting us know  "   I say to her . \
  "  No problem .  Where do you girls stay at ?  "   she asked us . \
I look at Jordyn .    "  Well actually , nowhere at the moment  "  \
  "  Why don't you girls stay here for the night ? I will cook something for you to eat  "   she said .  Jordyn and I placed our hands on our stomachs .  We were starving . \
  "  Thank you  "   I said to her .  I knew we would get a good night sleep tonight .  Jordyn and I filled our bellies up and slept on the bed upstairs .  I couldn't believe that there was actually a cow in the house . \
Jordyn and I woke up refreshed and energized .  The woman was downstairs sitting at the table .  We get up and head downstairs . \
  "  I , well we would like to thank you for letting us sleep here for the night .  But we must go , we have somewhere we need to be  "   I tell her in a polite manner . \
  "  Thank you , and I appreciated the company .  It gets lonesome sometimes , but I do have something for you  "   she says getting up from the table .  She walks over to the corner of the room .  She grabs a box and brings it to the table . \
  "  This was my sons .  I would like to you have it .  Its dangerous out there  "   she says to me . \
I look back at Jordyn and she gives me a look .  I walk over to the box and open it .  It was a sword . \
  "  You don't have to give me this  "   I say . \
  "  No , I want you to have it .  He fought a great many of people with that sword when Ganondorf took over .  I would like for you to have it  "   . \
I kindly say 'thank you' and we walk out the door . \
  "  What she can't give me a weapon ?  "   Jordyn says to herself with jealousy . \
  "  Well one , you do not know how to use a weapon .  Two , you do not know every crook and cranny in Hyrule  "   I say to her . \
I hear her sigh .  We exit Kakariko . \
  "  So where are we headed ?  "   she asked me . \
  "  Kokiri .  It's a place where children never grow up .  It's a forest .  They were once protected but the Great Deku Tree , but Ganondorf destroyed him whenever he would not give him one of the spiritual stones  "   I explain . \
Jordyn didn't reply .  We make our way to Hyrule field again .  As we walk to the forest , I keep looking back to see if He was watching me .  After a while , we reach the forest entrance . \
  "  What is this ?  "   Jordyn asks .    "  It's like a made of wood ?  "   she says knocking on the entrance way . \
  "  Well maybe because it is  "  \
We step inside , sword in hand .  We walk over the bridge . \
  "  Wait  "   I say to her .    "  Before we step into Kokiri , there are these monsters .  They are called Deku babas , and Deku scrubs .  Deku babas are basically like a venus fly trap , but they actually will hurt you .  Deku scrubs are like the Octorok from the water .  But they spit Deku seeds at you .  But when we get in there run and follow me  "   I explain . \
She nods in approval .    "  Okay , ready one , two , GO !  "   I yell . \
We run into Kokiri .  The Deku baba to our right rises up .  We run right past it .  I head towards Links house .  I scream as the other Deku baba rises up .  I forgot that it was there .  I swing my sword .  I hit it in the head .  I lunges at me again .  I swing my sword and slice its head off .  I look back at Jordyn and her face was pale .  I climb the ladder to Links house .  We walk in .  Everything was so little . \
  "  Okay , since the Great Deku Tree is dead , the Deku Sprout is alive .  We have to go talk to it  "   I tell Jordyn . \
  "  Wait ? We have to go back out there ?  "   she asks me . \
  "  Ugh yea ?  "   I say . \
  "  Well you can go , but I will stay here  "   she demands . \
  "  Fine , it's not like you were any help at all anyway  "   I say walking out the door .  I jump down and head to the right .  I jump over the little pieces of land , trying not to fall in the water .  After I finally made it across , I make my way to the Deku Tree .  As I gaze upon its beauty , I slowly walk up to it .  It was so sad to know that something so wonderful was now just a symbolic being .  I walk up to the Deku sprout . \
As I open my mouth to speak , I hear something .  Something jingly .  Then it appears .  I couldn't believe it . \
  "  Navi ?  "   I say . \
She flies up to me with her brightness . \
  "  LISTEN !  "  \
A/N : hey guys ! Sorry it has been like 3 days since I have last updated .  IT HAS BEEN FOREVER ! I still haven't been feeling well .  But I do appreciate with views and the reviews .  So Beth has found Navi .  What will happen next ? Leave a review on what you think about the chapter and also ideas for the next because they are always appreciated thanks !\
  "  LISTEN  "  \
I stood there , silent .  It must be so .  Link was actually dead . \
  "  Who are you ?  "   Navi says . \
  "  My name is Beth .  I am not from this world , but I know everything about it .  I know your name is Navi and I am actually looking for Link  "   I say to her .  I know that I have been told that Link is dead , but a part of me believes it isn't so . \
  "  Link is dead .  All of Hyrule is demolished .  There is no hope  "   she says to me .  Her brightness fading . \
  "  But how was I able to obtain the Ocarina of Time ?  "   I question .  I hold the Ocarina in front of me . \
  "  Where did you get that ?  "   she asked astonished . \
  "  I found it in the moat leading into Castle Town .  That's where it is supposed to be  "   I say to her .  I was a little confused .    "  But what I don't get , is how did Ganondorf take over Hyrule ? The Door of Time had to have opened .  The Spiritual Stones had to have been found .  And the Sacred Realm had to have been unlocked  "   . \
  "  I know it doesn't sound right  "   Navi says .  She flies over and sits on my shoulder .    "  I was there that night .  I was with Link .  He had just got the last Spiritual Stone .  Zora's Sapphire .  I noticed something was odd about the entrance way .  The drawbridge was drawn up before dusk .  I tried to tell Link , but he didn't want to listen .  As we walked up to the drawbridge , all we heard was galloping .  The drawbridge was let down .  Princess Zelda and Impa ran away .  They escaped the castle .  Ganonodrf was right behind them , but by the time they crossed the bridge , he was too far away .  He lost them .  He stopped right in front of us .  He asked which way they went .  Link didn't respond , he just drew his sword  "   Navi says .  She stops for a moment .  I knew this was hard on her . \
  "  Ganondorf gave a deep chuckle and said 'you've got guts boy' .  Then he created this ball of magic and threw it at him .  It killed him instantly  "   .  Navi cried on my shoulder . \
  "  But how ?  "   I questioned .    "  He was the Hero of Time .  It couldn't have killed him that easily  "   . \
  "  Yes it could .  Because he wasn't the Hero .  He didn't bear the mark of the Hero  "   she says sobbing onto my shoulder . \
I furrowed my brows .    "  But ? I mean who is the Hero ? How was he able to get the Spiritual Stones ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Very carefully .  We snuck and got them .  Zelda believed he was the Hero .  Impa taught him Zelda's Lullaby and we went from there  "   she confronts . \
  "  But I still don't understand how Ganondorf got into the sacred realm without the Ocarina ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Well I flew off after he attacked and killed Link .  As I look back , I see him take the Spiritual Stones and head back into Castle Town  "   she tells me . \
  "  Okay ? Well even if he has the Spiritual Stones , he still has the have the Ocarina to open the Door of Time ?  "   I say , but it sounded more like a question . \
  "  That is something I haven't been able to figure out yet either  "   Navi says to me .  She flies off of me and lingers in front of my face . \
  "  What if you done it ?  "   she says in excitement . \
  "  Did what ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Saved Hyrule ! You have the Ocarina  "   she says flying all around me . \
  "  You can't be serious .  First off we would have to find Sheik , and since she knows the Hero is dead , then she will forever be in hiding  "   I say .    "  So it's pointless  "   . \
  "  Sheik is a she ?  "   she asks me . \
  "  Yes .  Sheik is Princess Zelda  "   I say to her .    "  You didn't know that ?  "  \
Navi shakes her head from side to side . \
  "  Well thanks  "   I hear a voice say .  I turn around and sure enough , it's Sheik . \
  "  You know people go into hiding , so no one knows who they are  "   Sheik says to me . \
  "  Well excuse me your majesty , but I had no idea that you would be so close to hear what I have to say  "   I say with a bit of sarcasm . \
  "  Well no worries now .  I mean my cover is blown anyway .  So surprise  "   Zelda came back with . \
  "  Okay stop !  "   Navi said .    "  We aren't going to get anywhere with both of you arguing  "  \
  "  Okay that's fine , just hand me back the Ocarina  "   Zelda says .  You know for her to be a Princess , shes a real bitch . \
  "  No  "   I say flat out . \
  "  No ?  "   she repeats . \
  "  Yea , No ? Did you not hear me the first time ?  "   I say making a stance . \
  "  Girl you have something coming for you .  Hand it to me and no one gets hurt  "   Zelda threatens . \
  "  No , because if I hand it to you , then you will get captured by Ganondorf  "   I say . \
  "  No I want .  He doesn't even know that I am alive  "   she says snobbishly to me . \
  "  Well Princess , if it makes you feel any better , he actually does .  He has been tracking your every move .  You were waiting for the Hero to come and teach him all the melodies to all the Temples and disappear afterwards .  Trust me he knows where and who you are  "   I announce . \
  "  How did you know that  "   Zelda asks me defensively . \
  "  It doesn't matter  "   Navi chimed in . \
Zelda well Sheik makes her way towards me . \uc0\u8232   "  I told you to hand it over  "   she says with hate .  She forms a ball of light in her hand and throws it at me .  I hold my hands up .  I knew that that wouldn't provide any protection .  I look up and was amazed .  I had a shield around me . \
  "  What the-  "  I said .  Zelda stood there dumbfounded . \
  "  It can't be  "   Zelda and Navi said at the same time . \
Nayru's Love surrounded me .  I fall to my knees from the pain I just felt in my left arm . \
Zelda falls to her knees to . \
  "  What .  . is .  . happening ?  "   I say between breaths .  Whatever it was , it was powerful . \
I feel it .  I feel a burning sensation .  It feels like someone has took a fire and thrown my hand in it .  I look up and scream .  Courage .  The Triforce of Courage was on my hand . \
Wisdom was on Zelda's . \
  "  You ? You are the Hero ?  "   Navi says flying over to me . \
Zelda peers up .    "  She can't be .  How ?  "   she asks .  I honestly have no idea what is going on right now .  It is a dream come true , but it is also a painful one . \
  "  I have no idea  "   I say . \
I get up .    "  I have to go get Jordyn and tell her  "  \
  "  Whos Jordyn ?  "   Navi asked . \
  "  She is my friend that came with me .  We went to Links house and she didn't want to come , so I left her there  "   . \
We all stand in defense from the ear ranching scream we hear .  Jordyn ? I run .  I run towards Links house .  Zelda and Navi behind me . \
  "  HELP !  "   Jordyn screams . \
I stop in my tracks as I approach Links house .  Ganondorf .  I look back at Zelda .  Her eyes wide as saucers .  Her skin white as snow . \
  "  Didn't think I would find you Princess ?  "   Ganondorf chimed .  Zelda didn't say anything .  He has Jordyn by her neck .  Her feet dangling inches away from the ground .  My only thought was for him not to kill her .  He looks at me .  Those eyes .  They were so lustful . \
  "  Hello Hero .  I see that you are a girl .  Weakling .  If you want to see or save your friend again , come to my Castle  "   he says to me . \
Did he just call me a weakling ? My blood was boiling .  He throws Jordyn over his horse and gets on .  We watch as he rides out of Kokiri . \
I turn towards them . \
  "  Let the journey begin  "  \
A/N : HEY EVERYONE ! I'm finally better and will be updating every night around the usual time 11p . m ! So what do you think about this chapter ? Can you really believe Beth is the Hero ? Will she be able to make it or will be fail Hyrule ? Anyway I just want to say thank you to all the viewers who hung in there with me on the days I couldn't write .  Thank you ! So leave a review on what you think and some ideas  :] thanks guys !\
  "  Let the journey begin  "   I say with my eyes peering up .  I was ready .  I had beat the game endless times .  But I didn't know where this sudden set of confidence came from . \
  "  What are we going to do ?  "   Zelda asked . \
  "  Well I don't know what you are going to do , but I'm going after the Master Sword , then straight to the Forest Temple  "   I say to her . \
  "  Obviously , I mean about your friend ?  "   Zelda snobs back . \
  "  Well he is keeping her like he would have kept you .  But this makes no sense .  In the game , he captured you at the end when you gave Link the light arrows  "   I say scratching my head . \
  "  The game ?  "   Navi and Zelda said in unison . \
  "  It's complicated to talk about okay ? To sum it up , they made a game about your world  "   I say . \
  "  How could someone make a game about our world and we never seen them ?  "   Zelda questions me .  I face palm myself .  I knew that this would happen . \
  "  Okay that doesn't matter right now .  What matters is , we need to get all of the Medallions .  From there all the Sages will build a bridge to reach Ganondorf's Castle .  So we need to hurry because I have absolutely no idea what he will do or pull with Jordyn  "   I say to them . \
While we were discussing what our next plan was , Ganondorf was focusing on his plan with Jordyn . \
  "  Where are you taking me  "   Jordyn demanded . \
  "  Woman , you are quick with your tongue .  I would advise you to watch your temper  "   he said to her . \
  "  You are Ganondorf aren't you ?  "   she asked him . \
He halted the horse to a stop .  He turns around to look at her .    "  Do you really not know who I am ?  "   he said in a serious tone . \
  "  I mean , I have heard a lot about you  "   Jordyn tells him . \
  "  And what have you heard ?  "   he questioned . \
  "  Well Beth and I aren't from here .  We are from a place called Earth .  Well they made a game called the Legend of Zelda and she is like addicted .  Well usually everyone's favorite character is Link , I guess because he is the Hero .  Well Beth's favorite character is you  "   Jordyn spills . \
  "  Me ? Why me ?  "   he acts curiously . \
  "  Well she has always had a crush on you .  Even though you were fictional .  Well not anymore  "  \
Ganondorf pulled his fingers around his chin and gave an evil grin .    "  Hmm I see  "   . \
Even is Jordyn didn't know anything about the game , she knew that she just made a mistake .  That look meant so many things .  Ganondorf turned back around and kicked the horse .  They made their way to his Castle . \
  "  Okay so are you with me or what ?  "   I ask them . \
  "  Well Ganondorf exiled my father .  I'm in  "   Zelda said lunging her arm forward . \
  "  He killed Link , so I'm in as well  "   Navi said .  She couldn't really put her hand in , so she just stood on top of Zelda's . \
I lay my hand under Zelda's .    "  Alright ! Then let's go !  "   I yell .  We broke off like we were some kind of team .  We walked out of Kokiri without harming or getting harmed by the Deku Baba's and Deku Scrubs .  As we walked across the bridge , about to head into Hyrule Field , I stopped for a brief second . \
Saria .  Her and Link made a connection here .  Right here in the very spot I am standing .  She knew the whole time that he wasn't a Kokiri , but she treated him as if her were .  It was such a precious moment . \
  "  What are you waiting on ?  "   Zelda yelled at me . \
I just shook of the emotion , and headed out of the Forest .  We make it to Hyrule Field .  It was dusk .  We started walking towards Castle Town .  I noticed something odd .  I know that in the game , there was always music playing .  So I started humming the theme that played in Hyrule Field .  Navi and Zelda looked at me like I was stupid . \
  "  What ?  "   I say . \
Zelda just grinned and shook her head .  As we made our way closer , I decided to change the tune .  I started humming Zelda's Lullaby . \
Zelda stopped dead in her tracks .    "  How do you know that ! ?  "   she asked me . \
  "  The game  "   I say quickly . \
She didn't say a word , she just kept her eye on me .  We reach Castle Town .  I'm not going to lie , I was scared to death .  The ReDead were scary .  But not as scary all the Wallmasters .  Those suckers came out of nowhere . \
  "  Okay just run for it .  There is a clear path right between the one that is crouching in front of the fountain , and the one where the potion shop used to be  "   I say to them .  Zelda nods .  Navi just hid in the back of my shirt .  We make a run for it .  By the time the ReDead stood up , we were already at the steps of the Temple of Time .  We walk up to the Temple .  As Zelda walks in , I just stand back glaring at the monstrosity .  It was beautiful . \
  "  Hey Hero , are you coming  "   Zelda jokes . \
I chuckle and head inside .  Now the music did play in the here .  That sweet deep harmony that I cherished so much .  I walk up to the alter .  Three Spiritual Stones lay there .  I was surprised I could read Hylian . \
'Ye who owns three Spiritual Stones stand with the Ocarina of Time and play the Song of Time'\
But how ? How was Ganondorf able to get through here with it ?\
  "  This is all my fault  "   Zelda says . \
I turn around to look at her in confusion .    "  What do you mean ?  "  \
  "  If I wouldn't have thrown the Ocarina , none of this would have happened .  Ganondorf wouldn't have been able to reach the Sacred Realm  "   she says .  Tears rolling down her face . \
  "  That's impossible .  The Ocarina was laying right where it was supposed to be  "   I say . \
  "  That's because he put it back there .  He got it out of the water , thinking I didn't see him .  He got it and used its power for evil .  He placed it back in the water waiting for me to come back and get it .  He was trying to trap me .  He wants the Triforce Beth .  He will kill us to do so  "   Zelda sobbed in her hands . \
I walk over there to her .  I rub my hand across her back .    "  Zelda this isn't your fault .  You didn't know that he was going to kill Link .  You thought Link was the Hero .  You saw it in your dreams .  This is not your fault , so don't blame yourself  "   I say with kind words . \
  "  Now let's go get that sword  "   I say . \
I walk up the stairs , with Zelda and Navi following , and slowly head towards the Master Sword .  There is was .  It was beautiful .  I place my hands on the purple hilt .  I let go of it .  I turn around with fear in my face . \
  "  Wait .  What if I remove it , and I get sent back in time seven years ago .  What if I am a little kid ? I wasn't born in Hyrule , so where would I go ?  "   I say frantically . \
  "  Beth , it is okay .  You would go to the silent realm and back  "   Zelda assured . \
  "  Are you sure ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Yes  "   she said . \
I turn back around .  I place both of my hands on the hilt .  I take a deep breath and pull it out .  A blue light engulfed me .  It felt as if I were flying almost .  When I open my eyes , I was surrounded by darkness . \
I look down .  I couldn't believe myself .  The Chamber of Sages . \
  "  Hello  "   said a voice . \
I turn around .    "  Rauru ?  "   I ask not knowing . \
  "  Yes my child  "   he said in a calm voice .    "  I know who you are Beth .  I know why you are here  "  \
  "  I know to .  I am the Hero .  It is my duty to save Hyrule  "   I say to him . \
He chuckles   "  Take a look around you  "  \
I look around me .  There is no possible way .    "  Saria ? Darunia ? Ruto ? Impa ? Nabooru ? All the sages are here .  Except for Zelda .  Why isn't she here ? What is going on ?  "   I ask .  My head was spinning .    "  I thought Ganondorf killed all of you .  All of you are supposed to be in the Temples  "   .  I grasp my head . \
  "  Beth darling  "   Rauru said   "  This is not the game  "   . \
I look up at him quickly .    "  How did you know about that ?  "  \
He chuckles again .    "  I know who you are .  We all know who you are .  Ganondorf did not put any kind of evil into the Temples because he thought just like everyone else did , that the Hero was dead .  He cut off their supplies .  He froze Zora's Domain .  He vanished the Kokiri .  He locked up the Gorons  "   . \
  "  But why ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Because they will not bow down to them .  He killed all of us .  The sages , to show the others he was in charge  "   he explained . \
  "  But I don't get it ? Then what am I here for ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Because it is your destiny .  You really don't know who you are do you ?  "   Rauru said . \
  "  No I don't .  I would love for someone to tell me  "   I said getting angry . \
Rauru chuckled .    "  You will see in time  "   I could feel time pulling me back .    "  Just know us sages will always be with you  "   was the last thing I heard from him . \
I return back to the Temple of Time , only to find Zelda in a pink prism .  Frozen in Time .  I run up and bang on the glass . \
  "  No !  "   I scream .  Jordyn and now Zelda .  What was my destiny ?\
  "  Hello Beth  "   I heard a deep voice say . \
I knew who I was .  I turn around .  There he was .  Flaming red hair and desert eyes staring at me . \
  "  What do you want with me ?  "   I demand . \
  "  Oh I think you know .  If you want to rescue your friends , then come by my Castle  "   was all he said .  That was it .  He snapped his fingers .  Just like that he and Zelda were gone .  All I had now was Navi . \
Rauru's words rang in my head   "  Because it is your destiny  "   .  What is my destiny ?\
A/N : Alright peeps ! Now that Beth's plans got rearranged , what do you think will happen next ? I NEED IDEAS ! Haha ! But anyway thanks KEN for reviewing my story and thanks to all the viewers I have had ! You have been awesome !\
What is my destiny ? I think to myself .  I turn to Navi   "  He wants me to go to his castle  "   I say to her . \
  "  Well I would imagine so .  I mean you need to rescue Jordyn and Zelda  "   Navi says to me . \
  "  Exactly .  That is his plan .  He wants me to come unprepared  "   I say with excitement . \
  "  Oh ! Well then where should we start first  "   she asks me . \
  "  You know Navi , don't take this the wrong way , but for you to be a 'navigator' you aren't that smart .  But I still love your aggravating self .  Okay , we need bottles for fairies .  We always have to have fairies .  Rauru said none of the Temples were cursed , so they should be a breeze to get into .  We need the Hookshot from Dampe's grave , the Bow from the Forest Temple , the Megaton hammer from the Fire Temple , The longshot from the Water Temple , the Eye of Truth and Hover Boots from the Shadow Temple and the Gauntlets and Mirror Shield from the Spirit Temple  "   I explain .    "  But the most important thing of all , my green tunic  "   .  I knew it wasn't mandatory , but hey if I'm going to act the part I need to play the part . \
Before we head out of the Temple , I soon realize something . \
  "  Hey Navi ?  "   I call out . \
  "  Yea ?  "  \
  "  So how am I supposed to learn the songs if Zelda isn't here to teach me them ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Maybe you should try to play them first and go from there  "   she tells me .  She had a point .  I mean who knows .  The storyline isn't exactly going how it should be .  I lift the Ocarina and place it up to my lips .  I play Zelda's Lullaby .  I couldn't believe it .  One , I didn't know I knew how to play .  Two , it worked !\
  "  Alright lets go  "   I say to her .  We walk out of the Temple of Time and head towards the dead .  I stop on the steps .  I whip out the Ocarina and play the Sun Song .  The ReDead froze right there .  I smiled to myself .  I felt like a badass .  We ran pass all of them and headed towards Hyrule Field . \
  "  Okay we need some bottles  "   I say .  I thought about going here and there like I did on the game .  But then it dawned on me .  Well if Link already got the Spiritual Stones , then Link must have gotten them .  She did say they barely made it . \
  "  Hey , did Link have any bottles  "   I ask Navi . \
  "  Yea  "   she replies . \
  "  How many ?  "  \
  "  Three  "   she says .  Great .  I don't feel like killing any Poes to get a flipping bottle . \
  "  Well maybe the Potion Shop has some  "   I say .  I lead the way to Kakariko Village .  I place my foot on the first step and look up .  That's a lot of steps .  I don't know why I didn't notice it before .  We walk up the stairs and head into the Village . \
We headed to the left , towards the Potion Shop .  We walked in and I went up to the register . \
  "  Um hey .  I was wondering if you had any empty bottles that I could have ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Sure I have two right here  "   he says to me . \
He places them on the counter .  I grab them and head towards the door . \
  "  Um Miss ! Wait !  "   he calls out to me .  I turn around . \
  "  Yes ?  "   I say with a concerned look on my face . \
  "  You owe me Fifty Rupees  "   he says . \
Wow ! All this time in Hyrule and I couldn't find any blasted money .  Better start cutting pots and grass . \
  "  Wait you let me have these  "   I reply . \
  "  No ma'am .  They are Twenty-Five a piece  "   he tells me . \
  "  No no , I asked you if you had any bottles that I could have .  Meaning that you didn't want and you would give to me  "   I say to him . \
  "  You aren't leaving here with them without paying  "   he threatens me . \
  "  And what is going to stop you ?  "   I egg on . \
He put this look on his face .  I cock my eyebrow up .  If he thinks he is going to walk all over me because I am a woman , then he is sadly mistaken . \
He turns his frown upside down and says   "  Have a good day miss  "   .  With that being said , Navi and I walked out the door . \
  "  Okay now we have to go get some fairies , but first while we are here we need to get the Hookshot  "   I say . \
Navi nods in approval .  I held the bottles in my hands and headed towards the graveyard . \
  "  Okay it's this grave right here  "   I say to Navi . \
I slide the headstone back and jumped in the hole .  Sure enough , there was Dampe .  Floating with a halo above his head . \
  "  Hey missy .  Think you can keep up with old Dampe .  Well if you can , then I'll give you a prize  "   he tells me . \
  "  Alright  "   I say back .  He heads off and I follow .  I'm trailing him until he throws the flames . \
  "  How did I forget about those ?  "   I say angrily at myself .  I pick myself up and run after him .  Dodging here and there .  After about a minute or so of close calls I finally made it . \
  "  Well well congratulations .  You are quick on your feet lady .  Well as I promised , there is a chest waiting for you .  Claim your prize  "   and with that he vanished .  I hear this noise , so I turn around .  It was the green magic that circled around when a chest popped up .  I was so excited .  My first chest .  I slowly open it up .  Exaggerating the moment .  The green light came out of the chest .  I look down to claim my prize . \
The Hookshot .  I slowly raise it out of the chest . \
  "  Let's test it out  "   I say with excitement .  We walked up the stairs .  I played the Song of Time to remove the block .  After the block was removed , we were in the windmill .  That joyful song that guy hated so much .  I jump down and take a ride .  We head towards the door .  I knew that the Hookshot grasped the shingles on the roofs . \
  "  You ready Navi ?  "   I ask her .  She flies over to me and lands on my shoulder .  I point the Hookshot and fire .  I scream in absolute excitement flying through the air .  That was awesome .  I land on the roof .  My only problem now was getting off .  I look down and take a leap .  I hit the ground grunting . \
  "  Alright Navi , lets head to the forest  "   I say .  I limp for a couple of moments after taking the leap of death and walk out of Kakariko . \
We head down the stairs and over the bridge .  We make our way to Kokiri Forest .  About half way there , I hear a whinny .  A horse whinny .  Epona ? I turn around and horror crossed my face .  Ganondorf . \
  "  Navi run !  "   I yell .  I ran .  I never ran so fast in my life .  I could hear the hoofs gaining on us .  We were so close .  I scream as I felt and arm grab me .  Ganondorf grabbed me under my arms .  He pulled me up on his horse .  He sat me in front of him , his arm holding me around my waist .  He pulled me against him .  My back against his chest . \
He leans dangerously close to my ear and whispers   "  Hello darling  "   .  I couldn't move .  He takes his hand and places it over my hand .  It was like he had a curse on me because I could not move ! I feel myself becoming sleepy .  I collapse .  My arms drape on both sides of his horses neck .  He turns the horse around and heads towards his castle .  I try my best to stay awake , but his magic is to powerful .  All I remember seeing is Navi .  She has lost Link and now me .  What is she going to do now ? She has no one . \
A/N : SO this story took a huge turn around ! Okay so Ganondorf has Beth , what is going to happen now ? I NEED IDEAS ! Thanks to the reviews and the views !\
As I woke up , I noticed I wasn't able to move .  I tried moving my arms , but they were apparently held down .  As well as my legs .  I turn my head to look at my hands .  Restraints her holding my wrist and ankles down .  I close my eyes for a brief second .  I had a huge migraine .  Why ? Out of all people , why me ? I wiggle my wrist to try and loosen the restraints .  I stopped when I heard someone coming .  I laid there still .  The door opened .  No one cared to knock . \
  "  Well how did you sleep ?  "   he asks me .  Ganondorf .  My heart leapt out of my chest .  Could he really be here ?\
  "  What are you going to do with me ?  "   I ask him .  He doesn't answer just yet .  He just gives a hearty chuckle .  He walks over to the bed .  I'm guessing that this is his bed chamber .  He sits down on the side of the bed .  He gently cascades his fingers over my legs .  My skin flares up . \
  "  Liking this are we ?  "   he plays . \
  "  No  "   I spit out . \
  "  You may tell me one thing Beth , but your body is telling me another  "   he says dangerously .  He continues to torture me .  Why ? Why did he have to endure me with his touch ? It was almost as if he knew my secret .  Just like when guys ran their fingers through my hair . \
  "  Can you please stop  "   I try to say nicely . \
  "  How bad do you want me to stop ?  "   he continues . \
  "  Real bad  "   I state .  He removes his fingers off my body .    "  Why do you have me tied up anyway ?  "  \
He gets up off the bed .    "  Well , so you won't escape  "   .  He shakes his head and smiles .  My face turns beet red .  That was a stupid question to ask . \
  "  Well can you untie me please  "   I ask , even though it sounded more like begging . \
  "  Why should I ?  "   he asks me deviously . \
  "  Well for one my arms and legs are going numb  "   I throw out there . \
He walks over to me and pulls out a dagger .  My heart starts racing .  Was he really going to kill me now ? He cuts the restraints .  I breathe a sigh of relief . \
I sit up slowly .  I didn't want to pass out from sitting up so quickly .    "  So where is Jordyn and Zelda ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Why ?  "   he responds .  I must admit , that wasn't the answer I was looking for . \
  "  Uh , maybe because I would like to know where they are and how they are doing  "   I snob back . \
  "  They are safe  "   he replies . \
  "  How do I know that I can believe that ?  "   I say . \
  "  And who are you to question me ?  "   he replies angrily . \
  "  I am Beth , now tell me where they are  "   I demand .  I yell as I feel something come across my face .  Ganondorf had struck me .  He towered over me .  I placed a shaky hand up to my cheek .  I winced at the tenderness . \
  "  Listen here wench , you are not to speak unless spoken to .  Do you understand me ?  "   he demands .  I don't reply .  I am still shaken from what just happened .  He leans down and grabs me by my throat .    "  I said do you understand me ?  "   he says through gritted teeth . \
I shake my head 'yes' .  He lets go of my neck .  He gets up .  As he walks off , I try to pull my legs towards me .  He trips over my feet .  As I watch him fall , I say my life flash before my eyes .  I knew this was the end .  He lands with a loud thud .  I pull my legs towards my chest .  He looks at me , his eyes filled with every possible negative thing you could ever imagine .  Hate , rage , hostility etc . \
He grabs my ankle and slides me towards him .  I gasp .  I could feel the cold stone against my back . \
  "  You are going to regret that  "   he says to me in rage . \
  "  Ganondorf I didn't mean to  "   I try to explain .  He doesn't listen .  He is breathing hard through his teeth .  He balls up his fist and collides it with my face .  I scream .  I could feel my cheek swell .  He wraps his hand around my throat .  I couldn't breathe .  He raises his fist again , and hits me in the same spot .  I knew that broke my face .  I could feel the blood seeping out of my face .  I claw at his hand .  This only angered him more .  He tightens the grip around my throat . \
I knew if he tightened it up anymore , h would break my esophagus .  He finally raised his fist one last time and did his final blow .  He hit me in the right eye .  I scream as loud as I could .  It wasn't that loud , but a very raspy scream .  He removes his hand from around my neck .  I could feel the blow flowing back to my body .  My right eye swollen shut . \
He gets up .    "  Disgusting wench .  You do not know who you are dealing with  "   he says as he spits on me .  I didn't know what to do .  No one had ever treated me like that before .  As he left , I laid there .  I laid there in my own blood .  I touched my neck .  I flinched from the bruising .  I get up and head to the bathroom .  There was a tall mirror in there along the wall .  I nearly fainted at the sight of myself . \
My blonde hair matted from the blood .  The whole right side of my face was demolished .  My right eye was already black and blue .  It was swollen shut .  You could see bits and pieces of bone from my cheek .  What was happening to me ? Was being beat to death my destiny ? I notice in the mirror , that there was a bath behind me .  I turn around and walk to it .  I run some hot water .  I grab some towels that were right beside it . \
I slowly get into the tub .  The warm water welcomed me .  I finally lean back and relax .  It seemed like whichever way I turned my head , I was in so much pain .  I leaned my head back against the tub and drift off into a sleep . \
A/N : okay guys , sorry for such a short chapter .  This chapter focused on just Ganondorf and Beth .  He basically beat her pretty bad because HE tripped over her foot .  So its HIS mistake .  But I guess now we know that he has a quick temper and that he is always right .  Okay so Beth managed to get into the bath and relax .  So what do you think will happen next ? Maybe Ganondorf will heal her ? Or maybe he will beat her even more for using his bath ? But where do you think Jordyn and Zelda are ? Anywho any ideas are great ! Please review ! Thanks guys !\
  "  You will hand it over , if I have to take it from you !  "   Ganondorf demanded . \
  "  You are going to have to kill me first .  I would never hand this over to you  "   I tell him .    "  You are a monster .  You killed my best friend and Zelda  "   . \
  "  Why yes , yes I did .  And now with them out of the picture , I now have both pieces of the Triforce .  Now all I need is you  "   he says in a deep voice to me .  I was in a weakening stance .  I had lost all of my strength in this battle between Ganondorf and I . \
  "  So what is it going to be 'Hero' ?  "   he asks me , emphasizing on the 'Hero' . \
  "  Like I said Ganondorf , you would have to kill me first  "   I say with my chest heaving up and down .  I was not built for this kind of movement . \
He looks up at me through hates eyes .    "  Then so be it  "   .  I gasp as I feel something grab both of my arms .  Stalfos .  They were holding me back .  Ganondorf steps towards me .  He raises his sword and stabs me in the stomach .  I scream out in agonizing pain . \
  "  So be it Beth  "   he says . \
I feel someone shaking me .  I gasp and sit up .  I shake my head .  What a nightmare that was ! I look beside me feeling a presence in the room .  I scream .  Ganondorf . \
  "  What are you doing in here ? ! Get out !  "   I yell at him .  I curl my legs up to my chest and wrap my arms around my chest .  He just chuckles . \
  "  Well , I was wondering if you were dead or not .  You have been in that tub for about an hour  "   he says to me . \
I furrow my brows in conferment .    "  You came up here to check on me ?  "   I say not really getting the situation . \
  "  Yes  "   he says flat out . \
  "  How long have you been in here ?  "   I ask him . \
  "  About five minutes  "   he told me as a grin came across his face . \
My eye widen in horror .  Was he looking at me ? I didn't ask because I was afraid of what his answer might be .  He sits down on the side of the tub .  I just stay still .  He cups my chin in his hands .  I wince at the pain . \
  "  Your face is beaten pretty badly  "   he compliments . \
  "  I wonder why  "   I say in a low voice . \
  "  Well maybe because someone doesn't know how to hold their tongue  "   he replies .    "  Well I am going to have to do something about that , because I don't want anyone seeing your face like this .  It isn't attractive  "   he tells me flat out . \
You know all these years me having a crush on Ganondorf , he really is a dick . \
  "  Who is going to see me ?  "   I ask him .  He gave a low chuckle .  He didn't answer my question right then .    "  Lean back  "   he tells me . \
I was a bit sketchy at first but I tasked .  I lean back against the tub .  Everything still covered . \
  "  Beth  "   he says . \
  "  Hm ?  "  \
  "  I really don't think there is any room for modesty now  "   he says still grinning . \
  "  Well I feel safe like this  "   I say to him\
  "  You don't feel safe around me ?  "   he asks . \
  "  No ? Why would I ? You practically beat me to death about an hour and half ago  "   I tell him . \
  "  Alright Alright  "   he says .  Who was this man ? One minute he is a raging lunatic , and the next he is all caring and compassionate\
  "  Lean your head back  "   he tells me .  I lean my head back .  I can feel both of his hands lingering above my face .  I yell out as he places his fingers against my cheek and eye .  I could feel him grab me around the neck again .  My heart starts beating fast . \
Ganondorf starts mumbling these words .  I could feel the pain go away .  Was he heeling me ? I wondered .  He removes his hands off of me .  I open my eyes .  I no longer felt the swelling and throbbing of pain .  I could breathe without flinching . \
  "  Why ?  "   I ask him . \
  "  I told you , I don't want anyone seeing your face the way it was  "   he tells me again . \
  "  So you don't want anyone seeing the person you really are ?  "   I say back quickly .  I knew I had struck a nerve .  I could tell it by the expression on his face . \
  "  Alright time to get out  "   he says getting up from the side of the tub .  I sit there for a moment waiting for him to get out . \
  "  What are you waiting for ?  "   he asks me . \
  "  For you to leave  "   I say . \
He gives a hearty laugh .    "  Darling , that's not going to happen  "  \
I got to open my mouth   "  Don't say anything , get out  "   his tone becoming stronger .  I crouch to my knees , so he doesn't see anything .  I then stand up .  He reaches out a hand . \
  "  The tub gets slippery  "   he says . \
  "  I don't need your help perv  "   I say hatefully to him . \
I raise my legs and go to put it on the mat .  Sure enough , the tub was slippery .  I slipped .  I could feel someone catch me .  Everything happened so quickly .  When it was all done , Ganondorf had his arms around me and my hands were on his shoulder .  There was no covering up now . \
  "  I tried to tell you  "   he said with a grin .  I will say , if it he wouldn't have caught me , my head would have probably hit the side of the tub . \
I didn't know what to do .  I was stuck between a rock and a hard place . \
  "  Do you have a towel ?  "   I ask him . \
  "  Nope  "   .  I gasp as I feel myself being picked up .  He carried me into the bedroom .  Was he going to rape me ? My heart started beating fast again .  Here I was naked in his arms and in his bedroom .  He sits me down on the bed .  I exposed to his eyes .  He unpins his cape and drapes it around my shoulders .  Was he trying to make up for the fact that he beat me ?\
He walks over to the window .  He places one hand on his hip and one hand on the window .    "  Beth  "   he says looking out of his castle . \
  "  Yes ?  "   I answer . \
  "  Give me the Triforce of Courage  "   he flat out demands .  I was starstruck . \
  "  N-No  "   I baffle . \
He turns around to me .  His eyes piercing through my soul .    "  Alright , well get dressed  "   he says . \
  "  Get dressed ?  "   I say to myself . \
  "  There are clothes laid out behind out  "   he tells me . \
  "  Where are we goi-  "   he cuts me off . \
  "  Get dressed  "   he says in a strict tone .  I listen .  I get up with his cape still around me , and get dressed .  It's so sickening that he watched me the whole time .  After I get dressed , he reaches out his hand .  I take it and we head out of the door .  As we walk to wherever , I start to wonder .  Was that it ? Just tell him 'No' to the Triforce . \
  "  What are you thinking about ?  "   he asked me interrupting my thoughts . \
  "  Nothing  "   I say . \
  "  You were thinking about something  "   he says to me .  What now I have to tell him what I am thinking ? I roll my eyes .  I soon hear voices .  People talking .  We turn the corner .  It was a room full of people .  People whispering and chatting .  They made a clear walkway for us .  Straight ahead was two tall throne chairs .  I was unfamiliar with this room .  It wasn't in the game . \
My biggest thought was , what were we doing here ? We walk up to the thrones .  He guides me and I sit in the right one .  He gives a little bow and sits beside me in the left one .  The crowd gathers around . \
  "  Greeting to you all  "   he begins .  His voice boomed through the room .    "  I have brought you all here today for a fantastic ceremony  "   he says .  I look around the room .  Everyone was staring at me . \
  "  Now as you all know , this is Beth .  She tells me that she is not going to give me the Triforce of Courage  "   . \
My eyes widen in fear .  What did he just say ? Was everyone going to beat me ? Why did they have to know ?\
  "  Bring her in  "   he yells .  The crowd looks behind them .  The guards brought in a woman .  She had a sack over her head .  She was stripped naked .  I felt so sorry for whoever that was .  The crowd makes a circle around them . \
  "  You may release her  "   he booms . \
The guards remove the sack .  I gasp and stand up .  My hand covering my mouth .  This girl had been beaten .  Bruises covered all of her .  Cuts around her legs , ribs and back .  Jordyn !\
  "  Ganondorf is this outrageous !  "   I yell .  He takes my hand and jerks me to sit down . \
  "  Now Beth do you hand the Triforce of Courage over ?  "   he asks me .  I didn't know what to do .  Jordyn and I have been friends since we were little .  And now she is barely unrecognizable . \
  "  Beth  "   Jordyn musters out . \
I look up at her .    "  Don't do it  "   she says .  I close my eyes and tears roll down my face as the guard hits her in her side .  Jordyn falls to the floor . \
  "  Ganondorf stop this !  "   I scream at him . \
  "  You know what you have to do  "   he says with a grin on his face . \
  "  Isn't there another way ?  "   I plead . \
  "  No  "   he says sternly . \
I know he could see the hurt in my eyes , but he was so heartless .  I rise up out of my seat .  I take a step towards Jordyn .  Ganondorf pulls me back .  I struggle to get out of his grip . \
  "  Do it !  "   he commands .  Then it happened .  It was so slow .  It was almost as if someone slowed time .  The guard removed her swords .  She placed them in front of Jordyn's neck .  The blades crossed , but never touched .  As I fell to my knees , Jordyn's head was decapitated .  The crowd cheered . \
I scream in sorrow .  Tears painted my face .  I watched it as it rolled a few feet in front of her corpse .  I felt Ganondorf grab me under my arm to pull me up .  I turn around towards him . \
  "  You bastard !  "   I scream pushing him away from him .  He maintained that smirk on his face .  I had no idea what I was thinking , but my hand collided with his face .  His smirk being slapped off . \
  "  How could you !  "   I continue . \
  "  There is more where that came from if you don't corporate  "   he tells me .  I could barely talk .  I was in so much pain .  He grabbed me under my arm again and led me out of the throne room .  We walked pass Jordyns body .  We walked pass the crowd .  I cried the whole way out .  My legs became weak and fragile .  I collapsed to the ground .  I was too weak for anything .  I felt him pick me up and carry me .  This was the last person I wanted to see , but I was too weak . \
The throne room became smaller and smaller , while he headed to his chambers . \
A/N : whoa ! Okay so Jordyn is dead ! All because she wouldn't hand over the Triforce ! Do you think Ganondorf would do the same thing to Zelda or Beth ? Well you will have to stay tuned for more ! Anyway thanks to the viewers and the reviewers ! Let me know what you think !\
We ascended the stairs to his chambers .  I was sick to my stomach .  This was a ruthless heartless man .  How could anyone be this cold ? He didn't say a word to me , as we went to his chambers .  I didn't know if he would have his way with me there to try to get my piece of the Triforce , or what .  Honestly , I didn't care anymore .  I didn't have anyone .  My best friend had been slaughtered in front of me and that was all I had .  I was tempted to just let him have it . \
We reach his bed chambers .  He doesn't let me out of his arms .  He walks over to the bed , and lays me down .  Here I was , just waiting for anything to happen next .  I was done .  I was defeated .  But instead of getting on top of me , or touching me , he simply walks over the window .  He gazed outside . \
  "  You know  "   he began   "  I will obtain it  "   . \
  "  I really don't care anymore Ganondorf  "   I told him .  I had no emotion .  I was nether sad or mad .  I was in mourning . \
  "  You don't ?  "   he questioned . \
  "  No .  I told you if you wanted it , you would have to kill me .  So I'm waiting .  Go on .  Go ahead  "   I said with dignity .  I knew better then to just hand it over , even though I wanted to so bad . \
He chuckled to himself .    "  You will hand it over  "   he said daringly .  I didn't reply .  I soon figured out that Ganondorf was a man of last words .  So , I let him have his victory .  After about five minutes of silence , I decided to ask the where abouts of Zelda . \
  "  Where is Zelda ?  "   I ask flat out . \
  "  Why does it matter ?  "   he answers back sarcastically . \
  "  Because I said it does .  Where is she ?  "   I could feel myself getting angry . \
  "  And who are you to talk to me the way you are ? Do not forget Beth where your place is  "   he said to me hatefully . \
  "  Oh I know where my place is  "   I say getting off the bed and facing him   "  My place is on Earth .  Just because you think you have to get your point across from beating women , makes you the lowest man alive .  You are a pitiful excuse for a 'King'  "   I say quoting with my fingers . \
I could see I had pissed him off .  His expression changed .  He turns towards me and heads in my direction .  I stand in place .  I would take another beating for this .  I wasn't going to let him think I was a coward . \
He stands in front of me , ready to strike .    "  Listen here whore , I am the rightful King of this kingdom .  I will treat anyone and everyone the way they should be treated .  If they step out of line , they will pay for their consequences  "   . \
  "  Rightful King ? Overthrowing a kingdom is not rightful Ganondorf .  You were so busy worrying about this Kingdom that you lost interest in your own people !  "   I say raising my voice .    "  You are no king .  You are a coward .  A coward who has no self-respect for anyone but themselves .  That's why you want the Triforce .  Just for yourself  "   .  I kept going on and on .  I had no idea why my mouth would not shut up .  I was pacing back and forth . \
  "  And just to think that I actually liked you ! You are no one ! You will never find someone who appreciates you , if you cannot appreciate yourself !  "   I finished one that note .  I was waiting to get beat down again . \
He grabs me my arms as I pace in front of him .  I jerk my head up to look at him .  There I stood waiting for his blow .  His lip was curled up .  His eyes glowing amber .  His jaw set .  He had a tight grip on my arm . \
  "  Go ahead Ganondorf .  Hit me  "   I say staring him right in the eyes .  He pulls me to him and the unthinkable happened .  His lips met mine .  My eyes widened .  Was this happening .  Why ? How can someone be so angry and then be so caring ? I was one to read people , but him I could not .  I closed my eyes and let him take advantage of my mouth .  His hands moved to my lower back .  My arms wrapped around his neck . \
If anything was good about Ganondorf , it was his lips .  Well with that being said , he did live with a bunch of women .  His lips were like velvet against mine .  Warm and smooth .  I could feel his tongue pressing at my lips .  I opened my mouth .  He deepened the kiss .  I let out a breath moan .  He moved his hand behind my neck .  I moved my hands to the side of his face . \
Was I really making out with the King of Evil ? I break the kiss to get some air .  I wipe my mouth with my arm .  I could feel his gaze upon me .  My face turned so red . \
  "  Beth , I have a proposal to offer  "   he said to me .  I just stare at him .  He gets down on one knee . \
  "  Stand beside me .  Take my hand .  Rule with me Beth .  Be my Queen  "   he says taking my hand . \
  "  Why ? Why now ?  "   I ask him .  This was a bit odd . \
  "  I have been watching you Beth .  While you were on Earth I had been watching you .  Your beauty is impeccable .  Your nature is nurturing .  No one has ever talked to me the way you did .  No one can stand up to me the way you do .  I need a woman like that Beth  "   he tells me . \
He stares at me waiting on an answer .  I take in a deep breath . \
  "  Alright .  I accept  "   I say to him . \
That evil grin comes across his face .  Maybe it wasn't evil , maybe that was normal for him . \
  "  So when is the wedding ?  "   I ask him . \
  "  Two weeks  "   he says . \
  "  Two weeks ! That isn't enough time to plan a wedding .  Why so early ?  "   I question . \
  "  Darling , for my race that is plenty of time .  I have a Castle full of workers , so you don't have to do anything  "   he explains . \
I didn't say anything .  Believe it or not , I trusted him with this . \
  "  Well , I have to go talk to the council about this .  I will be back soon  "   he says .  He gives me a kiss on the cheek and heads out the door .  I stand there .  Was I really getting married ? At twenty years old ? I go and walk over to the window where he always stood .  I open the window .  Cool air breezed in .  I sit on the ledge and lean my back against the wall .  As I look out the window , I could see all of Hyrule .  I was really about to rule this . \
I could see Lake Hylia , The desert , Kakariko and little bit of Kokiri .  As I am looking , I see this light moving in the distance .  It kept getting closer and closer .  Navi ? Oh my gosh it was ! My heart leapt for joy . \
She flew up to me .  She landed on my lap out of breathe .  Her face told it all . \
  "  Navi what is the matter ?  "   I asked . \
  "  It's Zelda  "  \
A/N : alright ! So what do you think about this chapter ? So Beth stands up for her right and Ganondorf admires her for that .  He asks for her hand in marriage and she accepts .  Well Navi and Beth are reunited and something terrible has happened to Zelda ? What could it be ? I need suggestions lol ! I hope you enjoyed !\
  "  Navi what is the matter ?  "   I ask . \
  "  Zelda  "  \
  "  What is the matter with her ? Is she okay ?  "   I ask frantically . \
Navi begins to cry .    "  No .  You need to hurry and follow me  "   she tells me . \
  "  Navi I can't leave here  "   I say . \
  "  But you have too ! Zelda's life depends on it !  "   she begins to yell . \
  "  Fine , but where do we need to go ?  "   I question . \
  "  The dungeons  "   .  For some odd reason , when she said that , I thought of Jordyn .  Jordyn was held in the basement , where she was beat and tortured .  I knew that if I was to go down there , I would not be able to contain myself .  But who was I ? Why was I being so selfish ? This was Princess Zelda we were talking about . \
  "  Okay , just lead the way  "   I say to her .  Navi gets off of my lap . \
  "  We will have to head through the Castle .  But I will go ahead and check to make sure there aren't any guards  "   she tells me .  I nod in approval . \
Navi flies to the door . \
  "  Wait  "   I say .  She turns around and looks at me .    "  I might need a weapon , just in case anyone wants to start a commotion  "   I say . \
  "  Where is the Master Sword ?  "   she asked me confused . \
I stood there for a moment .  Where was it ? I had totally forgot about it .  I look under the bed , in the closet , the bathroom .  There was no sign of it .  What had Ganondorf done with it ?\
  "  I don't know where it is  "   I say frantically .  She just looks at me with fear in her eyes .  That was the only way to defeat evil .  It was evil's bane . \
  "  Well let's just come on  "   she says .  I grab the fire poker for the fire place .  I open the door and let her lead the way .  She motioned for me to come on .  I stopped at a nearby wall .  Navi had turned the corner to make sure the coast was clear .  This was not the kind of follow the leader I like .  This was life or death .  She gave me the cue and I kept on . \
We carefully made our way to the dungeon doors . \
  "  Okay , so the guards are on break .  They should be back in about an hour .  That should be enough time for you to talk and get back  "   she tells me .  I open the dungeon doors . \
  "  Leave me alone  "   I hear a weak voice say .  Zelda ? I follow the voice .  She was in the middle cell . \
  "  Zelda ?  "   I say .  She looks up at me .  She was so pale and malnourished .  I cringed at the sight of her . \
  "  Beth ?  "   she replies .  She gets up with weak legs .  She falls back down from the lack of nutrients .  Tears blurred my vison from the sight of her .  Jordyn could barely walk when they brought her in . \
  "  What has he done to you ?  "   I ask her . \
  "  He is starving me to death .  I won't give him what he wants , so he is making me suffer .  He thinks it is going to make me weak and give him my piece  "   she tells me . \
I didn't want to ask , but the words left my mouth before I had a chance   "  Was Jordyn in here ?  "   The pain hit me . \
Zelda closed her eyes .    "  Yes  "   she muffled out .  She crawled over to the cell bars .    "  Sit please  "   she suggested .  I gently sat down across from her .  Bars blocking our way .    "  I will tell you everything that happened  "   she said .  I wasn't ready to face it .  But they say you will never overcome your fears , if you don't face them .  I took in a deep breath . \
  "  Jordyn and I were placed in the same cell .  This one right here .  Obviously she was in here before I was .  She was starting to grow ill .  She had some cuts and bruises , but not many .  She was crying so hard when I came I got here .  Of course I asked her what was wrong , and she said that she was afraid for you  "   .  Zelda's voice was hoarse .  She cleared her throat . \
  "  She said when Ganondorf got her that day , on the way here she told him your secret .  That you have always had feeling for him  "  \
I closed my eyes .  I was so hurt and so angry at her .  No angry for my sake but for hers .  Ganondorf probably figured that since she knew that , then she would know more . \
  "  Well he tried to get more out of her because you were so close , but she didn't know anything .  I was here whenever they took her away .  The guards came in and beat her .  They beat her in the ribs , stomach and back .  They cut her so she would bleed fresh blood  "   Zelda told me . \
My eyes began to sting .  Tears flowed down my cheeks .  I couldn't listen to this .  I felt a hand grab mine . \
  "  Where is Jordyn now ?  "   she asks me . \
  "  Dead  "   I say .  I look up at Zelda's face .  Horror . \
  "  Ganondorf had beaten me as well .  He healed me and told me that he didn't want anyone seeing me like this .  I didn't know what he meant until we went into the throne room .  There were lots of people .  People I had no idea existed .  He led me to one of the thrones and sat me down , then he sat down .  The crowd make a circle and they brought her in .  I had no idea who it was .  She was naked and had a sack over her head .  Ganondorf asked me to hand him over the Triforce of Courage and I didn't oblige .  So he commanded the guard to cut her throat  "   I began to weep .  Zelda squeezed my hand for comfort . \
  "  Beth  "   she says with kindness .  I look up at her . \
  "  You did what had to be done .  Jordyn is back safe and sound  "   she tells me . \
  "  What do you mean safe and sound ?  "   I ask her . \
  "  She is back home .  Where you are from .   "   She says . \
  "  So all you have to do is die and you will return ?  "   I question . \
  "  For anyone other than you .  Rauru told you , this is your destiny .  I don't know what it is .  Only you will find out .  You are destined to be here Beth .  It is your purpose  "   she tells me . \
I felt a light in me .  A dim one , but it was still hope . \
  "  What else has he done ?  "   she asked me . \
  "  Well he asked for my hand in marriage  "   I said . \
  "  Be careful Beth .  Ganondorf will do anything to get that piece .  Don't let him trick you .  He is a man of many words .  He is very devious .  Just watch out  "   she tells me . \
Clapping .  Clapping echoed from the dark distance .  My heart dropped .  Zelda's eyes widened in fear .  All you saw was amber circles .  He emerged from the darkness . \
  "  Well well , what do we have here  "   he says eyeing Zelda .  Zelda crawls back towards the wall .  I go to stand up , but he forces me back down . \
  "  No no sit , we have a lot to talk about  "   he says with that grin on his face . \
Hey guys , sorry it has been so long but the computers where I stay quit working .  So I have to wait until they some more .  I'm writing this on my phone , but I promise I haven't forgot about you !\
-Gerudothief\
That clap sent chills down my spine .  I watched him appear from the shadows .  I knew that this couldn't be good . \
  "  Well well , what do we have here ?  "   he asked rhetorically .  I knew better than to answer .    "  Hmm ?  "   He looks from Zelda to me .  I freeze .  His gaze made my stomach turn . \
  "  Zelda , I take it that you do not like the idea of us getting married ?  "   he says with a grin . \
  "  No one should marry you , you are a monster !  "   she yells . \
A sly grin forms on Ganondorfs face .  He clicks his tongue .    "  I believe someone is jealous .  Zelda weren't you the one who wanted to marry me at one point ?  "  \
Zelda's face turns from white to red . \
  "  Don't lie princess  "   he says cunningly .    "  See Beth , she didn't want you to marry me because she wanted me all for herself  "   . \
  "  Don't believe him !  "   she yells at me .  I didn't know what to say .  I was a bit shocked at the both of them .  Zelda wanted to marry Ganondorf and Ganondorf admitting to all of it . \
  "  Well what made you not want to marry her ?  "   I ask him . \
He looks at her with that grin still on his face , and looks at me .    "  She did not interest me  "   he said . \
Zelda's eyes widened .    "  That is a lie ! You were interested until you found out I didn't have a piece of the Triforce !  "   . \
I looked at Ganondorf .  I knew she had struck a nerve .  His expression said it all . \
  "  Beth  "   he says in a low voice . \
  "  Yea ?  "   I reply in a shaky voice . \
  "  Go to the bed chamber  "   he says . \
  "  Wh-  "   I was interrupted . \
  "  NOW !  "   he roars .  Before I turn around to leave , I take a look at Zelda .  She had made her way to the corner of the room .  This would probably be the last time I say her .  I turn around and made m escape . \
I didn't wait around to see if I heard any magic or screaming .  I had lost so much already , I didn't want to lose anything else .  I followed his orders and went to 'our' bed chamber .  I didn't know how bad my punishment would be , since I went down there .  I finally made it to the door .  I open it and go lay down on the bed . \
Question after question were running through my mind .  Is he going to kill her ? Will he tell me if he does ? What about Navi ? I nearly jump out of my skin when I heard the door open .  It was him . \
My heart stopped when I saw blood on his hands .  I didn't show any emotion . \
  "  Depending on how bad you react , is how bad your punishment will be  "   he says to me .  I didn't move .  I just stood there .  He walks up to me and opens the palm of his hand .  I nearly fainted when I saw what it was , but I just stood there showing no emotion . \
It was Navis wings .  I could feel him staring at me .  His eyes penetrating me .  He closes the palm of his hand . \
  "  Ahh , I see I have made you strong .  Very good  "   he says and walks away .  Was that it ? Was he not going to punish me ? He walks over to his desk and sits down .  He starts to rumble through paper . \
  "  Im going to go and take a hot bath  "   I tell him .  He doesn't respond .  He doesn't even look up .  I had to get away from him .  To him I showed nothing , but on the inside I was dying .  The walk from the bedroom to the bathroom was horrific .  I imagined every way he could have done that to her . \
I run my bath water and get in .  I made sure the door was closed because I didn't want Ganondorf hearing me cry .  I sit down and let the hot water burn my skin .  Tears left my eyes .  Why Navi ? I know she led me there , but Zelda was the one who spoke out of context .  Zelda was the one who wanted to marry you . \
Was I really getting jealous over her ? I hear the door creak open .  I try to wipe the tears from my eyes . \
  "  Are you crying Beth ?  "   he asks me .  He almost sounded concerned , but I wasn't going to let my guard down .  It might be a trick . \
  "  No , its just when I first got in here the water was hot and it made my eyes water , but its all good now  "   I said .  He just looked at me .  I had my knees brought to my chest so you couldn't see anything . \
  "  Alright  "   he says and walks out .  Was that it ? I shook it off and sank down into the water .  I closed my eyes and let sleep take everything away . \
A/N : hey guys ! Sorry for the super long wait .  I know this chapter wasn't that long , so sorry for that .  But I hope every one had a great thanksgiving , Christmas and new years ! I know I did ! But anywho just let me know what you think about the story so far .  Leave a review and thanks for reading !\
  "  Hylia you have to get out of here !  "   a voice yelled . \
Hylia , the first goddess , stood there waiting for Demise to make a move .  She was trying to get her people to safety . \
  "  You must go .  I will stay here and do my duties  "   she tells her people . \
  "  Your grace , come with us !  "   they yell .  Dirt and debris flew around them from a previous battle .  The ground started shaking . \
  "  Hylia no !  "   they screamed .  With the wave of her arms she removed a piece of land from the surface . \
  "  Do not worry about me .  It is by my grace to protect you  "   she said with a warm smile .  Tears strolled down her face as she sent her people into the sky .  It was her role to protect them .  To die for them . \
  "  Oh your grace , wasn't that touching  "   she heard a deep voice boom .  She turned around . \
  "  Demise , I have had enough ! You can not hurt my people anymore ! It is just you and me now !  "   she confronted him . \
  "  And so it is  "   he said with a malicious grin .  He runs towards the goddess raising his sword . \
I lunge forward gasping for air .  Water spilling over the side of the tub .  That dream was so real .  It took me a minute to realize where I was . \
  "  Nightmare ?  "   I heard a voice say . \
I jerk my head to the left and there Ganondorf was , staring at me .  I felt so exposed . \
  "  Can I get a little privacy please !  "   I scream . \
  "  Well the last time I gave you privacy , you were some place you weren't supposed to be  "   he says in a sarcastic tone . \
I roll my eyes and bring my legs to my chest . \
He clicks his tongue .    "  Temper temper  "   . \
  "  Can I please have a towel  "   I say through gritted teeth . \
He stood there , leaned up against the wall amused .    "  The towels are over here .  If you want one you are going to have to get one  "   he says with that grin on his face . \
I reach down and unplug the stopper in the tub .  While the water was going down , I just sat there . \
  "  Feisty are we ? Well Princess , I can play that game too  "  \
  "  Princess ?  "   I say to him . \
  "  Yes Princess .  You accepted my hand in marriage so you are now a princess , when we marry you will be my queen  "   he explains to me . \
I did not like the sound of being HIS !\
He hold out his hand towards me .    "  Ive got all day  "  \
I roll my eyes again and slap his hand away .  I knew I was on the border because he still hasn't done anything about me being in the basement . \
He growls under his breath .  I thought he was going to walk away but he just leaned back against the wall . \
I guess I had no choice .  I closed my eyes and took in a deep breath .  I stand up with my arms crossed over my breasts . \
I could see a smile creeping across his face .  I get one leg over the tub .  I wasn't going to look at him .  I knew he wanted to devour me , but I would try to delay it as long as possible .  I remove my other leg out of the tub .  I stand next to him to get a towel .  I hated that .  I remove one of my hands to reach for a towel .  I could hear his breathing start to get heavier .  I turned around quickly so he couldn't see me .  He grabs my arm and pulls me to him .  I scream . \
  "  What are you doing ? !  "   I yell at him .  My chest was against his . \
  "  I am not waiting any longer to have you ! You are mine !  "   Ganondorf roared .  I was dragged by my arms to the bed .  The whole time I tried to put up a fight by kicking and screaming , but it was no use . \
  "  Ganondorf stop !  "   I scream .  I scream even louder when I feel a hand connect to the side of my face .  I fly off the side of the bed . \
  "  Shut up you wench ! I have been nothing but considerate this whole time and this is how I get treated ? I haven't even punished you yet .  I could snap your neck with my two finger and yet you still tempt me ? !  "   He booms . \
I stand up and fight back .    "  Considerate ? What about Jordyn and Zelda ? ! AND NAVI ? ! You weren't considerate with them .  They didn't even deserve a punishment like you gave them !  "   I yell at the top of my lungs . \
Ganondorf is seething through his teeth .    "  So are you saying Beth , that you deserve a more gruesome punishment ? You don't even know what I did down there in the dungeon .  So what do you know about punishment ?  "   he says taking steps towards me .  I couldn't go anywhere .  My back was against the wall .  And I was exposed . \
  "  Well I will show you what I did  "   he says grinning .  He slowly raises his left hand .  The back of it facing me .  I gasped .  He had Power and Wisdom . \
  "  No  "   I breathe .  I could feel my legs starting to shake .  I was about to collapse .  He closes in on me . \
  "  Now we do things my way or you suffer a punishment  "   he says placing one hand by my head . \
  "  Rape is a punishment  "   I say looking him in his eyes . \
He chuckles   "  It wont be rape for long  "   . \
My eyes grow huge .  I replayed what he just said in my head over and over .  He grabs my arm again and throws me on the bed .  I walks towards me undoing his belt and pants .  I slide back , but he grabs my ankle and pulls me back towards him . \
  "  Ganondorf please stop  "   I beg .  He gives a sinister laugh and ignores me . \
He places one knee on the bed .  He takes his shirt off .  I couldn't help but admire his body .  That was the only thing good about him .  I close my legs real tight . \
  "  Shy are we ?  "   he says .  He places his hands on my knees and pulls them apart .  My whole body , inside and out exposed to the Evil King .  He bends his head down towards my area .  His eyes piercing through me the whole time .  He places his hands to creases of my hips .  I gasp .  I look at him and he shoots me that grin . \
His mouth was inches away from my entrance .  He takes his tongue across my clit .  He does it again .  I take in a breath of air each time .  Then , he repeatedly moves his tongue across my clit .  I throw my head back at this experience .  I was a virgin .  I had never felt any kind of sexual pleasure before .  He sticks a finger inside me .  I let out a slight moan . \
I could hear him chuckle .  As much as I didn't want this to happen , I also didn't want it to stop .  I love the way my body was feeling .  He pushed his finger in and out of me .  His tongue still worked in rhythmic motion .  Could it really get better than this ? His fingers were wet from my pussy .  He changed his finger motion .  He started in a 'come hither' motion .  I throw my head back and yell .  This felt so good . \
He moved his fingers faster inside me .  He moved his tongue in faster circles .  I could feel my body tensing up .  I could feel a tingling sensation inside of me .  I guess Ganondorf could feel it too .  He moved even faster .  I was so wet .  I could hear his fingers inside of me .  That turned me on even more .  The sensation became stronger .  I gripped the sheets and screamed .  He gets up and wipes his mouth .  I look at him .  He removes his fingers from inside of me and licks them . \
  "  Mmm a virgin I see  "   he says with lust in his eyes . \
  "  How did you know ?  "   I say . \
  "  Well for one you are extremely tight and second you taste fresh  "   he says giving me a grin .    "  Now my turn  "   he says .  I furrow my eyebrows in confusion .  Ganondorf takes his huge cock in his hand .  Stroking his shaft up and down .  My eyes widen .  It was huge . \
He grabs me by my arm again and makes me sit up .  He puts his cock at my mouth . \
  "  Suck it  "   he says to me .  I shut my mouth as tight as it will go .  He one of his hands and grasps my jaws and the other was still stroking his member .  He squeezes my jaws .  I had no choice but to open my mouth .  He takes the chance and puts his cock inside my mouth .  He puts both hands on the side of my head and thrusts his cock inside my virgin mouth .  My eyes teared up from his going to deep .  I gagged .  He didn't care .  He jammed it in my mouth .  Ganondorf leaned his head back and moaned . \
  "  You like that cock in your mouth don't you ?  "   he said to me .  Im not going to lie , it didn't turn me on more . \
I let a moan escape my mouth .  This excites him even more .  He removes his member from my mouth and flips me over on my hands and knees .  I could feel his cock and my wet entrance .  He reared back and jammed it in me .  I scream out in pain .  Ganondorf didn't take any consideration to that .  He kept going .  His balls slapping against my clit .  The pain went away and I started to moan .  My breasts bounced with the rhythm of him fucking me from behind . \
  "  Ohhh Ganondorf !  "   I moan out .  He had a death grip on my hips .  He leans his chest against my back and grabs my breasts .  His cock still pumping into me .  He takes his mouth and bites my neck .  I scream .  He straightens back up . \
  "  Harder  "   I moan out .    "  Faster  "   . \
Ganondorf did just that .  His balls kept hitting my clit causing me to roll my eyes back in pleasure .  The feeling was building up again . \
  "  You are going to come first  "   he breathes heavily .  I could feel it getting stronger .  Then finally I came .  I arched my back and yelled out .  I could feel Ganondorf losing rhythm .  He pulls out of me and flips me over .  I fall to my back and he straddles me .  His hand jacking off his cock .  He places it to my face .  I accept it and place it back in my mouth .  I could taste myself on him .  He places his hands on my head again and fucks my mouth .  I could feel his cock starting to tremble .  I knew it wasn't going to be long .  He throws his head back and roars .  His seed fills my mouth .  I continue to suck his cock .  I swallow his come and he removes it from my mouth . \
  "  You liked that didn't you ?  "   he says sexually .  I didn't say a word .  He places his hand to my forehead and mumbles   "  sleep  "   .  In the blink of an eye , all I saw was darkness . \
A/N : OOOOOOHHHHH KAAAAYYYY ! It has been forever since I have wrote to you all ! I finally got my computer up and running  .  Haha ! Anyway just a heads up and great news\'85 I GOT ENGAGED ! We are getting married May 2nd of this year but anyway enough about me .  So I want to say thanks to all the fans who hung in there with me during the delay of writing .  Thanks a million ! Okay , so just let me know how you like this story ! I know one thing , what a HELL of a LEMON ! Lol so just leave a review on how you like this story and how you think it will endA particularly cold and rainy night , Yuna and her best friend , Rikku , stood underneath the awning of the gas station , out of sight of the gas station employees .  Although , employees of gas stations and truck stop restaurants typically know very well what women hang around after hours for .  The pair stood awaiting for the right men to approach .  Rikku had more experience in this field than Yuna .  Rikku had been doing this for a couple of months now .  On the contrary , this was Yuna's first night on the   "  job  "   . \
  "  I'm really not sure how I feel about this .   "   Yuna admitted , after several moments of silence .  Her nerves had been going berserk ever since Rikku had brought up this idea , but Yuna was not in a position to say 'no' to easy money . \
  "  I felt that way the first time , too .  Some of these men really aren't so bad , you know .  Most of them are actually pretty sweet .   "   Rikku responded , in reassurance . \
These two had been friends for many years .  One of the things that had brought them together was the fact that they came from similar backgrounds .  Yuna's father , T . J .  , had been in and out of mental hospitals for several years , but he truly was a good man .  He had always worked so hard to provide for the family he had created before his mental illnesses began to interfere .  Yuna's mother , however , had really opened Yuna's eyes to the fact that not everyone is cut out to be a parent .  Sure , Serenity did care for Yuna and T . J .  , but she certainly did have a strange way of showing it .  Most of Yuna's life , she felt unwanted by her mother .  Serenity had several episodes while Yuna was growing up where she would randomly tell Yuna things such as ,   "  I wish I never had a GodD**n kid !  "   ;   "  I hate your f**king guts !  "   ;   "  You're just like your pill-popping , psychotic father !  "   Several of these things were said when Yuna was only five years old , and throughout her whole childhood and teenage years .  Now that she was old enough to change the direction of her life and make her own choices , she didn't hesitate . \
Rikku came from a similar childhood .  Her mother ended up in jail due to the abuse caused to Rikku as well as how unfit the house was .  Her father hadn't been around much at all , so Rikku's aunt had taken her in .  Kathy is as sweet of a woman as can be , but Rikku felt such an emptiness inside of herself .  She had never felt the love of a mother or a father .  It was very beneficial to Rikku to have a good woman role model such as her Aunt Kathy , however , Kathy obviously could never replace Rikku's parents nor repair the mental and emotional damage that had been placed upon Rikku's heart .  Rikku still stays with her aunt and Kathy had even been gracious enough to allow both the girls to stay with her until they could get on their feet .  Of course Rikku had regrets , as well as Yuna .  They have a safe place to stay and warm meals , but it didn't feel like home because they are still in this town that they've grown up in , which harbours much heartache and anger in both of these women's hearts . \
It has been hard keeping this a secret from Kathy , and both young women felt regretful of it , but it's simply the road they've chosen to walk . \
Perhaps that's the reason why they are making this decision ; they hadn't had very good guidance during their childhood years .  Now , it's time to make it in the world however they can manage . \
The two young women are both the sweet age of 20 , Rikku being only 4 months older than Yuna .  They needed to make money .  Fast , easy , ample money .  Truck-stop workers ,   "  lot lizards  "   , they both mean the same things .  These are women who provide pleasure/service to truck drivers who come to take a break , refuel their trucks , eat or even sleep . \
The young ladies had contemplated simply working at a gentleman's club together , however , they lived in a very small town of Centralia , Washington and word travels very fast .  They needed to make money without their mothers catching wind of where they were or how they were earning it .  The last thing either of these two ladies needed was yet another reason for their birth-givers to torment them .  A standard job of retail work , restaurant service , or a call center just isn't going to give enough money quickly enough .  They don't want to have to wait months to be able to get out of here .  The plan is ; work the lot just long enough to earn enough between them both to leave this small town and start over somewhere else , together .  California ? Possibly .  Oregon ? That would be nice too ! These two places are definitely at the top of the list . \
By the time these girls are done , they'll have enough money to go wherever their hearts desire .  Rikku is the only one with a vehicle , but it is in need of repairs .  Her 2002 Honda Civic just isn't in well enough condition to take a long trip , in addition to getting around in a new town .  In fact , doing this type of   "  work  "   is how Rikku has been able to keep her car running . \
  "  What if one of these men tries to like , take off with one of us or something ?  "   Yuna asked as she tightened her crossed arms around herself more as the numbing wind skimmed over her porcelain skin once more . \
  "  Psh ! Yeah right ! It's a very clear , but unwritten understanding .  They want our company for a little while .  We want their money .  We exchange and go seperate ways .  Nothing more , mothing less .   "   Rikku closed her eyes and smiled . \
  "  It's dirty money , Rikku .   "   Yuna felt hesitant when Rikku had first revealed her income source , but after some time and seeing how much Rikku was making , it started to sway Yuna .  However , talking about doing it and\'a0actually\'a0doing it are very different things .  Now that it was officially show time , Yuna had cold feet like never before , and not just because of the weather . \
  "  Yunie , it all spends the same .  How do you think I've kept that car going ? I usually make about , $400-$500 .  On a\'a0slow\'a0night ! I've left with over $900 a few times .  Both of us doing this ? Yeah , we can get out of this town and start fresh , work standard jobs , and just never talk about this ever again .   "  \
  "  So you're not proud of yourself after all ?  "   Yuna raised a brow to her friend . \
  "  Of course I'm not proud of this ! Who would be ? But where else are you going to make hundred and hundreds of dollars in a couple hours ? Besides a strip club .  We already established we can't do that , not here , at least .   "  \
  "  I know it's just .  Well , I'm just nervous .  I've never done anything like\'a0this\'a0before .   "  \
  "  Just hop in the truck .  They know what you're there for .  Plus , you're young and hot ! You should see what some of these females look like .  I think they're willing to pay us more just because we don't look like washed up crackheads .  Just follow his lead and you'll be fine , I promise .  Oh , it's the BEST when you find a nice , young man ! They aren't all old and creepy .  A lot of them are attractive and reasonably aged .   "  \
Just as Rikku had finished her sentence , a truck began to pull into the lot .  When he pulled up close enough for the girls to catch a few glimpses of his face , Rikku decided this would be Yuna's first customer . \
  "  Alright , Yunie .  Go for it .  He's a cutie !  "   Rikku patted Yuna on the shoulder . \
  "  Wait , he's getting out .   "  \
  "  Of course he is ! Look at him ! Girl , he's more fine than I thought ! He can be your first experience , lucky !  "  \
  "  Rikku , what am I supposed to do ?  "   Yuna didn't want to pass up the opportunity , but she didn't want to make the wrong approach and scare the young man away . \
  "  Oh , right , right .  Well , he's getting gas now .  Let's just see , he may come inside for some food or a drink .  If he goes to get back into the truck , go up and ask him if you can come inside and warm up .   "  \
  "  Okay , okay , I think I can do that .   "   It sounded easy enough to Yuna . \
The young man pumping gas was wearing a gray tank top , a black hoodie and blue jeans .  His long blonde hair was shimmering as the cold wind blew , but it didn't seem to phase him much at all .  He stood pumping gas for a few minutes before placing the nozzle back into it's holder .  After twisting the gas cap on and closing the small door , he made his way toward the gas station entrance . \
  "  Oooo here he comes !  "   An enthusiastic Rikku cheered . \
  "  Do I go up to him now ?  "   Yuna wondered . \
  "  No , just wait until he comes out .   "   Rikku instructed her inexperienced friend . \
It wasn't long before the young blonde was within feet of the two lovely young women .  They both offered him a warm , flirtatious smile , followed by a small and innocent wave .  His eyes remained locked on the females as he proceeded to open the door and enter the store .  Once he was inside of the store was when he broke the eye contact . \
  "  Rikku , he really is a nice looking man .   "  \
  "  Woo-eee ! Is he ever ? !  "   A school-girl smile crossed Rikku's face as she fanned herself with her hand momentarily . \
  "  Yes ! But , he doesn't seem like the type to go for a woman like us .   "  \
  "  What do you mean , 'like us' ?  "  \
  "  We're , selling ourselves , basically .  He's probably just going to kick me out and continue his route .   "  \
  "  Don't be so negative .  It's fine , I promise .  I mean , I will gladly take your place if you're backing out .  Like I said , there are attractive men that come through , but ones like him are few and far between .   "  \
Little did these women know just how true those last few words were .  He's truthfully not like the typical man most women come across on a day to day basis .  He's a rare one . \
  "  Oh my goodness .  He's checking out !  "  \
  "  Hmmmm , you haven't changed your mind .   "   Rikku nudged Yuna with her elbow . \
  "  If it was anyone else , I might have backed out .  But something is telling me I need to at least try this with him .   "  \
  "  That's the spirit .  Oh ! I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer , but just warning you : don't let any feelings develop .  I made that mistake twice and it just doesn't end well .   "  \
This warning made Yuna's heart drop slightly , but she nodded in agreement and awaited the young man to come outside . \
  "  I appreciate you ! Have a good night !  "   The gentleman said to the clerk as he walked out of the door .  He took notice of the two females still standing in the same place they were when he entered .  He offered them another quick smile before heading to his truck with his blue Gatorade in hand .  His seeming disinterest was slightly unsettling for Yuna , causing her to have brief second thoughts .  Yet , once the negative wave had passed , determination and hope had taken it's place .  With this new inner encouragement , she followed a few feet behind the mysterious man . \
He was now preparing to climb up into the driver's seat when a soft voice stopped him in his tracks . \
  "  Excuse me .   "   Yuna said in the sweetest voice she could manage . \
  "  Yes ma'am ?  "   He responded in a slightly concerned tone . \
  "  It's pretty cold out here .  Would you mind if I join you for a moment to warm up ?  "  \
His dark blonde eyebrows furrowed together slightly before a crooked smile passed over his handsome face . \
  "  I've got room for one more .  Come on in .   "   He finally said before taking his seat and closing his door . \
Yuna's eyes widened and her body froze for a few seconds , not believing this was actually happening .  Yuna looked back quickly to see Rikku in the distance raising her eyebrows with a proud smile .  This was Yuna's unneeded reassurance to continue into the truck , which she did . \
Yuna couldn't help but shiver loudly as she closed the door . \
  "  You really are cold , huh ?  "   The man teased . \
  "  Thank you for letting me in , sir .   "   Yuna was sincere in her words . \
  "  Not a problem at all .  Tidus .   "  \
  "  I'm sorry ?  "  \
  "  Don't call me 'sir' .  My name is Tidus .  And you ?  "  \
  "  Oh ! Right .  I'm Yuna .   "  \
  "  Yuna .  .  .   "   Tidus placed his index finger and thumb on the brunette's chin and lifted her face so she was looking into his eyes .  This sudden gesture caused her heart to thump so hard in her chest , she could swear he was listening to it .  This is the moment she noticed just how powerful his appearance is .  All she could think was how blue his eyes are .  It was like looking into a crystal clear ocean .  The way just a few strands of his long , sandy hair placed themselves so perfectly in front of those blue pools .  His tanned , smooth skin did nothing but enhance every feature this man had . \
The mere sight of him just this close in proximity was enough to make Yuna's blood rush quickly throughout her body .  Mature and inappropriate thoughts began to cross her mind as she remembered why she came into the truck in the first place .  For some reason , the thought of being with this man just one time was almost unsettling to her .  It shouldn't be , she doesn't know him .  Reality started setting in . \
Oh God ! I really don't know this dude ! He is just a random ! I'm in a semi truck with a man I don't know .  Sex .  He's about to pay me for sex .  Oh man ! This is it .  .  .  Hold your breath , Yunie !\
  "  Shh .  .  .  It's okay .   "   Tidus' voice was firm , yet gentle .  It was as if he had read Yuna's unspoken thoughts . \
  "  I didn't say anything .   "   Yuna said in a small voice . \
Tidus' hand found it's way to her cheek and he proceeded to caress it before leaning in closer to her .  He was studying her , just as she was with him .  She hadn't noticed , but he was extremely hypnotized by her eyes , as they were two different colors .  Her left eye was a dark blue while her right eye was as green as an emerald .  Her perfect , fair skin caused her eyes to stand out even more and the light shade of brown that her hair was made her all the more beautiful . \
  "  You didn't have to .  Energy doesn't lie .  You don't have to be afraid .   "   His warm breath felt relieving on Yuna's partially cold facial skin .  She began to relax with his words . \
  "  I know why you wanted to come in here .   "   Tidus stated as he backed away from her and let go of her cheek , taking Yuna by surprise .  She certainly didn't expect him to say that . \
  "  I told you why .  It's really cold out there .   "   Yuna tried to defend herself . \
  "  Right .  That gas station is a lot more warm and comfortable then this truck .  Oh , and your friend ?  "   Tidus cocked his head in Rikku's direction .    "  You came to warm up while leaving her to stand there and be cold ?  "  \
Nervousness struck Yuna's body and it showed on her face . \
  "  Well , you see , she's fine because she's-  "   Yuna was cut short . \
  "  Because she's going to find a truck for herself to jump into , hm ?  "   Tidus finished her sentence for her .  Yuna's lips parted and she had no clue what to say .  She hadn't expected the job to go this way . \
  "  I've been driving these trucks for about two years now .  I'm not oblivious , babe .  So just be honest with me and with yourself on why you wanted to come in here with me .  Don't lie to me .   "  \
Yuna's heart stopped the second he said   "  babe  "   .  She couldn't believe he called her that .  For some reason , it sounded so nice coming from his mouth , but was he seriously trying to argue ?\
  "  Okay .  Alright .  Fine .  Rikku is my friend's name and we are both in a situation where we just want to make enough money to leave this town .   "  \
Tidus placed his hands behind his neck and stretched as he nodded . \
  "  Continue .   "   He demanded . \
  "  Excuse me ?  "  \
  "  There's more to this story .  Because there's not a thing wrong with this town .   "   Tidus insisted .  This struck a nerve inside of Yuna . \
  "  Maybe not as far as you're concerned .   "   She spat .    "  And as far as\'a0I'm\'a0concerned , I owe you no explanations .  I came in here to do you a favor .   "  \
Tidus released a chuckle before replying . \
  "  Do\'a0me\'a0a favor ? Sex is not that important to me .  Not important enough to pay for .   "  \
  "  Of course it is ; you're a man .  A trucker , at that .   "  \
  "  What's that supposed to mean ?  "  \
  "  J-just what I said .   "   Yuna was suddenly feeling inferior to this man , but she did not want it to show . \
  "  I mean , pretty much all these men want nothing more than for an attractive young lady to pleasure them .   "   Yuna finished . \
  "  Oh ? Is that so ?  "   Tidus challenged . \
  "  I believe so , yes .   "   Yuna defended . \
Tidus effortlessly made his way into the passenger seat and on top of Yuna .  He had placed his hand over her throat firmly , taking care not to actually hurt her in any way .  Their lips were only a hair away from touching .  Yuna closed her eyes , releasing heavy breaths .  Her lips parted and although they hadn't kissed , she could already taste him .  His blue eyes darted over her face , taking in her reaction .  He leaned his face to the side of her head , placing his lips on her soft skin just barely below her ear .  Yuna began to breathe more heavily as she tilted her head the opposite way , submissively biting her bottom lip . \
  "  Is this what you expected , babe ?  "   His raspy , quiet voice was like music in her ear . \
Yuna released a long sigh and whispered back to him one word . \
  "  Yes .   "  \
Tidus placed his hand on the back of Yuna's neck and gently grabbed a handful of her short hair as his lips found themselves at Yuna's collarbone .  Tidus pulled her thin jacket and blouse to the side before gently nibbling at the sensitive area , clearly exciting his acquaintance .  She placed her hands on his shoulders and squeezed while slowly squirming underneath him .  He pulled at her hair firmly , but not painfully as his lips moved back up toward hers just as before , still not touching . \
  "  Get in the back .   "   He demanded in a dominant tone . \
As much as she wanted to , she remained just as firm as he was . \
  "  No .   "   She breathed . \
His eyebrows raised .    "  No , what ?  "   He asked in the same denanding tone as before . \
She shook her head .    "  I'm not getting in the back .   "  \
A proud smile waved over Tidus' face .    "  Good , because I wouldn't have paid you to .   "  \
  "  What ?  "   She wanted clarification . \
To Yuna's disappointment , Tidus slowly got off of her and back into the driver's seat . \
  "  I said , I would not have paid you to get back there with me .  I've never paid for sexual pleasure and I don't plan on starting tonight .   "  \
  "  But wait , what was that ?  "  \
  "  What was what ?  "  \
  "  That ! You don't want sex , but it's no problem for you to jump on me at random and-and-  "  \
  "  Ohhh , are you disappointed ?  "   Tidus teased . \
  "  No .   "   Yuna quickly said . \
  "  Remember what I said earlier ? Don't lie to me .   "  \
Yuna glared at Tidus , who was already looking her dead in her eye .  He did not like to be lied to , about anything . \
Yuna crossed her arms .    "  Yes , I'm slightly disappointed .  Happy ?  "  \
  "  Is it because you wanted nothing more than for an attractive young man to pleasure you ?  "   Tidus gave a cocky smile . \
  "  Okay , I take back what I said earlier .  No one likes to be teased , that's all I will say about that .   "   Yuna crossed her arms and looked out the window . \
  "  Oh , by the way , you shouldn't be disappointed .  You held up really well .  Truthfully , you don't strike me as a lot lizard .   "  \
  "  Well , you're my first encounter .   "   Somehow , this statement was relieving for Tidus to hear .  Yuna seemed like the type of female that 'should' be working toward a college degree .  She appeared as the type to welcome you with a warm smile as a waitress , that you want to tip extra because she took such good care of you during your meal . \
She appears to be the type that makes you want to come back into that specific retail store just because you know she will be there waiting to chat you up and and lighten your mood . \
The type to help people , perhaps as a medical assistant or nurse .  Maybe she loves animals and would make a great veterinary assistant .  She may even make a good counselor to troubled young women .  However , she belonged just about anywhere except this gas station , offering her beauty for money .  Tidus was pulled from his thoughts as he made his response . \
  "  I'm proud that you didn't just pull my pants down and try to go at it .  I mean , even after arousal , you still weren't quick to hop in the bed back there .   "  \
  "  You've had women just pull your pants down ?  "  \
  "  You'd be surprised what some of these chicks will do to try to convince us .  They want money and they assume all we want is sex .   "  \
This statement almost caused a feeling of slight jealousy , seeing how attractive Tidus is , and now getting a glimpse of how he is romantically , Yuna wasn't thrilled of the idea that random women approach him for sex and money . \
Random women like .  .  .  Me .  Why should I even care , though ? Like Rikku said , no feelings .  I can't possibly have feelings for a dude I just met . \
  "  I've kicked a lot of women out .  I've redirected countless women to my fellow truckers who I know were always more than happy to get some relief .   "  \
  "  Why didn't you kick me out ? You knew what I came to you for .   "  \
  "  Energy does not lie .   "   Tidus responded with a clever smile . \
  "  Ummm ?  "  \
  "  Energy doesn't lie , Yuna .  That's why I didn't kick you out .  Let me just say that I can sense energy very well .  You're troubled .  This doesn't have to be a way for you to help yourself out of your situation .   "  \
  "  What do you mean ? Rikku and I need money , and a lot of it if we want to establish ourselves somewhere new .   "  \
  "  I understand that , but you don't have to make it so difficult .  More importantly , you don't have to degrade yourself .   "  \
  "  What do you suggest we do ? Enlighten me , Obi-Wan .   "   Yuna's sarcasm was caused by slight annoyance in Tidus' demeanor of trying to tell her what choices to make .  Yet , on the same token , she was relieved that he actually wanted her to make better decisions .  It was a very confusing feeling , but she was glad that he was the one she ended up having her first encounter with . \
  "  If you need help , just try asking for it .   "  \
Yuna's eyes began to fill with tears , and Tidus noticed . \
  "  You don't really want to be a lot lizard , do you ?  "   He asked her . \
She shook her head . \
  "  Please help us out of this mess .   "   Her sentence was stated simply , but the pleading was obvious in her tone .    "  I have a lot to tell you , a lot to explain .  If you give me enough time , I hope that soon you'll understand why we are doing this .  Rikku has a car , but it's a piece of crap so she's been working the lot to keep it running .  I know she just had a lot of work done to it , but it's not reliable enough to take us long distance .   "   She finished . \
  "  Listen , we all have our reasons , okay ? You made it clear that you want to start over , I understand that much .  It's going to be just fine .   "   Tidus figured there was an abusive man involved that Yuna was trying to escape from .  Maybe Rikku was trying to get away from one and Yuna didn't want her friend to be alone .  Seeing the uncertain and uneasy feelings placed upon Yuna's beautiful face made Tidus want to be nothing but sincere and genuine to this young woman and to her friend as well . \
Tidus placed a hand on her knee .    "  Yuna , I will do my best to help you , alright ? Rikku , too .   "  \
  "  I really don't want to burden you .  I know you have a job to do , I just don't know what to think .  I never thought we would be in this situation .  I knew things were bad , but I never expected to believe that this would be an answer .   "   Yuna admitted before wiping a discreet tear from her right eye . \
  "  This isn't the answer for you , Yuna .  Not for you , not for Rikku either .  Maybe for other women , but not you two .  I told you I would help you both the best that I can .   "  \
  "  You don't say things that you don't mean .   "  \
  "  That's right .  I'm glad you can at least see that much about me thus far .  You girls can join me for a bit .  I may even be able to get you where you need to go .   "  \
  "  Anywhere but here would be delightful .   "  \
  "  I won't disagree .  Get your friend on board and we can head out .   "  \
  "  Thank you so much , Tidus .  You have no idea how much this means .  Let me go get her , I'll-  "   Yuna started to get out of the truck when she noticed Rikku was no longer standing at her previous spot . \
How long had they been on their journey now .  .  .  Weeks ? Months ? Yuna had lost track .  Many things had happened so far .  The attack at Luca , Operation Mi'ihen , killing Seymour , being forced to marry him , and Tidus coming to her rescue and .  .  . loving her in the lake here at Macalania .  So much had happened and Yuna wasn't entirely sure how everything else was going to play out .  But she knew one thing for sure , Sin had to die .  She wanted nothing more than to settle down somewhere with Tidus and live her life happily but .  .  . she just couldn't .  Not while Sin still lived .  And so Yuna pushed on , intending on dying , but taking Sin with her . \
They were staying one more night at the INN near Lake Macalania .  Yuna had requested it .  She was going to die , so she wanted to spend just one more night in the beautiful place where she had her first true love experience the night before .  Auron didn't approve of course , but oh well .  It couldn't be helped .  No one really knew what Tidus and her had done last night .  Kimahri had arrived only in time to see them kiss .  Before that though , they had done so much more .  .  . Yuna had her virginity taken from her last night .  It was an amazing experience , and one she was hoping to have again tonight if Tidus was willing .  Now she was sitting by the the water where they were last night waiting for him to arrive . \
  "  What's taking you so long .  .  .   "   Yuna muttered to herself .  She had spoken to him earlier and he agreed to meet her there around this time , but so far he was nowhere to be seen .  It was late , and so was he . \
Just then , Yuna heard a rustling in the bushes down the path a ways .  Was it him ? She certainly hoped so .  Yuna happily stood up and took a step towards it , but it was not Tidus she saw coming towards her . \
  "  Rikku ? Oh , what are you doing here ?  "   Yuna asked with surprise , but also a little disappointment . \
Rikku continued walking towards Yuna , a look on her face that wasn't the usual big dorky smile she wore , but a smaller and almost sad looking one .  Yuna noticed this , but simply awaited an answer from the small blonde girl . \
Rikku stopped at the water's edge and kicked at the ground ,   "  Well , certainly not the same thing YOU were hoping to do .  .  .   "   She said with an unusual despair in her voice .  Yuna grew immediately concerned . \
  "  Rikku .  .  .  Is something wrong ?  "   She asked quickly . \
The younger girl nodded her head ,   "  More than you know .  .  .   "   She responded . \
Yuna quickly abandoned all intentions of what she had in mind with Tidus .  Her cousin was clearly very sad , and her feelings were far more important than her own .  Yuna didn't hesitate and went swiftly to Rikku's side , wrapping her arms around her and pulling her close , resting her head on her shoulder . \
Yuna felt warm .  So warm .  So soft .  And always so kind , Rikku thought .  If only she knew just how much worse this made her feel .  Last night Tidus and Yuna thought they were alone , but they weren't .  Yuna was taking a while so , against the wishes of the others Rikku went to investigate .  What she found was Yuna and Tidus naked in the water .  Tidus had his hands all over Yuna's soft perfect body .  Yuna's soft moans weren't loud enough for the others to hear , but Rikku heard them .  Rikku had loved Yuna from the moment she set eyes on her .  She knew Yuna was her cousin , but she didn't care .  Yuna was far too kind , caring , strong , and beautiful .  Rikku couldn't help but fall in love with her .  She had never said anything if course , after all Yuna was another girl and her cousin on top of that .  She figured Yuna would never return her feelings .  What's more , she never wanted Yuna to think she was weird because of her feelings and distance herself .  Rikku loved her far too much to bare not being around her all the time . \
Rikku recalled the events of last night in her mind .  Tidus and Yuna were making love , and it broke her heart , shattered it into pieces .  Sure she never intended on telling Yuna how she felt , but that didn't mean she was happy to see her in someone else's arms .  As hurt as she was though , Rikku couldn't help but stare at Yuna's perfect nude body .  She hated what Tidus was doing to her , but at the same time she figured she'd never be lucky enough to see Yuna in such a sexual act again , and so with tears in her eyes , she took advantage of it .  She sat in the woods out of sight and watched them with a hand down her shorts imagining that it was her in the water , not Tidus , making Yuna make such noises .  With the impressive sight of Yuna's virginity being taken in front of her eyes , it hadn't taken long for Rikku to climax two or three times and exhaust herself .  That night she cried herself to sleep . \
Yuna's soft voice snapped Rikku out of her depressing thoughts . \
  "  Rikku , what's wrong ? You can tell me anything .   "   Yuna said kindly . \
Rikku shook her head , tears pouring from her eyes just as they had last night ,   "  No , Yunie , I can't tell you this .  Anything but this .  .  .   "   Yuna stroked Rikku's head and turned her face to look her in the eyes . \
  "  Rikku please .  .  . if you don't tell me .  .  . I may cry too .  I can't stand seeing you so distraught .   "   Yuna said . \
  "  No !  "   Rikku yelled out in objection .  Yuna crying was the last thing she ever wanted to see .    "  I'll tell you , I'll tell you ! Just don't cry .  .  .   "  \
Yuna was taken aback by just how much the idea of her crying upset Rikku .  It was a bit strange , but she figured that Rikku was clearly having a bad enough day already , so the thought of her dear cousin crying as well may have just been too much .  Yuna listened closely as Rikku finally spoke her mind . \
  "  It's just that .  .  . I mean .  .  . um .  .  .   "   Rikku hesitated .  Yuna urged her forward and looked at her intently , waiting patiently for the fifteen year old to say it . \
  "  Yunie .  .  . I .  .  . I love you .  .  .   "   Rikku finally said .  Yuna tilted her head in question . \
  "  Well .  .  . I love you too , Rikku .  I still don't see what the problem is .   "  \
Rikku shook her head quickly ,   "  No .  .  . not like that .  .  .   "   She muttered .  Yuna's confusion only furthered . \
  "  But .  .  . what do you mean ?  "   Yuna asked .  She was going to say more , but was stopped by the shocking turn of events of Rikku pushing her lips to her own .  Yuna's eyes widened and she instinctively pulled back . \
  "  Like that , okay ! ?  "   Rikku yelled out before breaking away from Yuna's arms and sitting on the ground , curling into a ball and sobbing heavily .  Yuna was shocked and at a loss for words .  Rikku was in love with her ? The thought was so sudden and strange .  Yuna had never thought about another girl that way , let alone her own cousin .  Yuna couldn't find words , and simply sat next to Rikku , stroking her back . \
  "  Rikku .  .  . how long have you felt this way ?  "   Yuna asked quietly . \
  "  Since the first day I met you .  I mean sure , at first I was only attracted to you , but as time went on I've been thinking about you more and more , and now I'm completely head over heels for you .  .  . I'm sorry Yunie , please don't hate me for it .   "   Rikku spoke through chokes of sobs . \
  "  Rikku .  .  .   "   Yuna muttered before pulling Rikku back into her arms .  Yuna held her for some time , allowing the small girl to let out all of her tears .  Rikku felt so comfortable in Yuna's arms , but the better she felt in her arms , the worse she felt , realizing she could never have her the way she wanted to . \
As Yuna held her , she began to feel strange .  She had always lived Rikku , naturally since they were cousins .  But this feeling she felt was .  .  . different .  She didn't really understand it , but she felt the overwhelming need to make Rikku happy . \
  "  Rikku .  .  .   "   Yuna began ,   "  Look , I do still love you , just .  .  . not the same way .   "   That was stupid , Yuna thought .  That was the worst thing she could've said .  She realized just how much damage she had just dealt to the poor teenager when her sobs grew heavier .  The feeling in Yuna's body grew worse , almost like seeing Rikku cry was the worst thing she had ever seen .  But she had seen others cry before , so why were Rikku's tears so heartbreaking ? Was it because she was family ? No she didn't feel quite so bad whenever she saw Wakka or Lulu cry , and she thought of them like siblings .  What was it then ? And why did she feel this sudden need to protect her and keep her safe .  Was it .  .  . no it couldn't be . \
Rikku looked up at Yuna's face only to see her lost in thought .  What could she be thinking about at a time like this ?\
  "  Yunie ? Please tell me you're not thinking about not liking me anymore ! I promise if that's the case I'll stop feeling this way somehow !  "   Rikku begged , desperate to stay by Yuna's side .  Yuna figured she should be happy that Rikku was willing to try to forget these wrong feelings of hers , but rather than relief , Yuna felt .  .  . sad .  Why would she be sad if Rikku DIDN'T love her ? The thought popped in to Yuna's head that maybe she loved her back .  But that could never be the case ! Rikku was another girl and her COUSIN ! She couldn't possibly have feelings for someone like that .  .  . could she ?\
  "  Rikku no .  .  . don't say that .  .  .   "   Yuna found herself saying without realizing what was coming out of her mouth .  She immediately covered her mouth as if erasing some sort of mistake . \
  "  But .  .  . so you're okay with it then ? With me .  .  . loving you ?  "   Rikku asked .  Yuna's feeling was growing stronger .  She had no doubt in her mind now that she did in fact love Rikku , but she knew it was wrong .  Rikku was her cousin ! And she loved Tidus ! No matter what she thought to herself though , the feeling was still there , pushing on her heart like a massive weight , and one she found impossible to ignore . \
  "  Yes .   "   Yuna finally answered ,   "  I'm okay with it .  .  . because I think .  .  . I love you too .   "  \
Rikku's eyes shot wide open and she looked at Yuna as if she has just told her the secret to defeating Sin for good . \
  "  Yunie .  .  . are you serious ?  "   Rikku asked in disbelief . \
Yuna gulped and slowly nodded ,   "  I am .  I never really thought about it before , but now that I am .  .  . I feel like I've loved you for a while now .  And I feel terrible about it for so many reasons .  .  .   "   Yuna's face contorted into a worried look .  Rikku felt confused and spoke back . \
  "  Yunie .  .  . why is it so terrible ?  "  \
Oh the reasons , Yuna thought .    "  Well first and foremost , I love Tidus too .  On top of that , I don't know how the others would feel about me loving another girl .  .  .  I feel like my father would be disappointed .  And of course , there's the fact that we're cousins Rikku ! It's wrong for family to love one another like this .  .  .   "   She explained and shut her eyes to fight back tears . \
At that , Yuna felt Rikku shift her body .  She felt Rikku place a hand on her cheek and turn her face towards hers .  The next thing she felt was Rikku's warm breath on her lips followed by Rikku's voice uttering a question .  .  . \
  "  Is it ?  "   Rikku asked and moved Yuna's lips to her own in a kiss . \
Yuna's eyes snapped back open and everything in her mind told her to pull away again , but she found herself unable to do so .  Her body seemed to have a will of her own .  Her muscles relaxed into Rikku's small arms and she found her eyes closing halfway .  Her entire body tingled in bliss as this kiss made her feel even better than the one from Tidus .  Still having no control of her body , Yuna pulled Rikku's body closer so that their entire upper bodies were pressed to each other and their legs intertwined with one another .  The two girls kissed deeply , eyes closed , and arms caressing each other's bodies lovingly .  They kissed for what felt like an eternity .  Yuna's mind was buzzing with hundreds if thoughts , but it felt too amazing to stop .  She never realized just how much of a hunger for Rikku's lips she had .  Rikku on the other hand had never been so sure of anything in her life .  This was all she had wanted since the moment she met Yuna .  She had dreamt about this , and pleasured herself to the thought of it many time . \
After some time , the girls finally pulled apart .  Both of their faces were red and they had dazed looks .  Rikku wasn't about to let this moment end though .  Yuna had just admitted something Rikku never once thought she would hear , that she did in fact love her as well .  Rikku was going to get as much out of this moment as she could then . \
After looking into Yuna's eyes for another moment , Rikku leaned over again and kissed Yuna on the cheek , followed by more kisses trailing down her face , then her neck .  Yuna sighed softly as Rikku's soft kisses and warm breath moved down her neck , sending another tingling sensation through her body .  Rikku kissed down to Yuna's collarbone , getting more sighs out of her beloved cousin , before moving back up her neck and face . \
Once at Yuna's ear , Rikku leaned in to it and whispered ,   "  Yunie .  .  . I want what you gave Tidus .  .  .   "   She then nipped Yuna's earlobe lightly . \
Yuna let out a slight moan at Rikku's action .  More thoughts swarmed through her head .  Rikku new about what she did with Tidus ? But how ? And now she wanted the same thing .  .  . but that's wrong !\
Isn't it ?\
Rikku kissed her way back to Yuna's mouth and planted another kiss on her soft pink lips .  This time though , Yuna felt Rikku's lips part , pushing her own lips apart as well .  She then felt Rikku's tongue slowly snake inwards , clearly tasting everything on the way in .  Both of their hearts were racing as Rikku savored every last taste inside Yuna's mouth and lathered her tongue with her own .  Their kiss grew more and more intense as the minutes went on .  Before long , Yuna gave in to her body's desires and wrestled back with her own tongue , pulling Rikku closer so her tongue could reach down her throat .  The girls caressed each other more intensely now , and their breathing grew heavy . \
Yuna's warring thoughts were all but quelled until she felt Rikku's hands tracing the the bottom of her kimono top .  Yuna knew what she intended to do , but wasn't sure she should let her .  However , her body continued to act on its own , and Yuna did nothing to stop her .  Not breaking once from the kiss , Rikku unwrapped Yuna from her kimono top and pulled it down her arms , leaving Yuna with just a black bra and her flowing sleeves .  The fact that Yuna hadn't stopped Rikku from doing this made Rikku feel empowered .  Without wasting a a single second , Rikku began to push Yuna down onto her back as she kissed her .  Yuna once again did nothing to stop her , in fact Rikku could feel Yuna pulling her closer as she was laid along the ground .  Rikku stayed on top of her , breaking from Yuna's mouth in order to once again kiss down her neck and collarbone . \
  "  Oohhh Rikku .  .  .   "   Yuna sighed as Rikku did so .  Yuna couldn't believe that she had just said that !\
Hearing a positive response from Yuna made Rikku feel wet in her panties and gave her an even hungrier lust for Yuna .  As she kissed , Rikku reached her arms around Yuna and unhooked her bra . \
Yuna felt as Rikku slowly pulled the straps down her arms .  Her hands were do much softer and gentler than Tidus' she realized .  Yuna turned pink as Rikku tossed the bra aside , leaving Yuna's breasts out in the open .  Rikku took a moment to look at them , marveling at the sight of Yuna's soft round mounds and the perfect pink nipples . \
  "  Yunie .  .  .  You're so beautiful .  .  .   "   Rikku said quietly , in awe at the sight .  Yuna's face reddened further .  Rikku smiled and leaned back in to continue kissing Yuna's body lovingly .  Rikku kissed up Yuna's stomach and around her chest before eagerly making her way to a breast .  Rikku took her time with it .  She planted kisses around every inch of ultra soft skin before finally taking the nipple into her mouth and sucking at it . \
  "  Aaahhh ! Oh Rikku .  .  .   "   Yuna moaned as she squirmed in pleasure at Rikku's gentle touch .  Rikku lapped her tongue all around the pink bud and then proceeded to lightly pinch it . \
  "  Oh God !  "   Yuna moaned .  She didn't know she liked her nipples pinched so much .  Rikku smiled widely at her reaction .  She continued pinching the nipple as she lowered her head back down and took the other one in her mouth , licking , sucking , and eventually nipping at it .  The whole sensation sent waves of pleasure throughout Yuna's entire body . \
  "  Oh God Rikku ! Oh don't stop !  "   Yuna moaned loudly , finally putting to rest any remaining objections she may have had .  As Rikku was taking turns on each nipple , she crept her knee upwards , scooting Yuna's dress up with it , and showing off Yuna's long luscious legs .  Her knee moved up and pressed against Yuna's now wet underwear .  A pair of damp black silk panties was all the sat between Rikku and Yuna's most sensitive spot .  That thought was enough to excite them both . \
Yuna was now completely lost in ecstasy , and before she knew it , was clawing at Rikku's orange shirt , pulling it up from her stomach .  Rikku giggle a bit and held her arms up , allowing Yuna to pull it off completely .  Once Rikku's shirt was off , Yuna looked at the orange bra almost with disappointment .  Rikku laughed and unhooked it herself , letting it fall on Yuna's bare torso and allowing Rikku's slightly smaller breasts to be free .  Yuna smiled and pulled Rikku back down into a kiss .  Rikku , still on top of Yuna , brushed her nipples against Yuna as she leaned in for another heated make out session .  Both girls moaned and panted at the feeling of each other's bare chests pressing against each other . \
Yuna ran her fingers through Rikku's soft blonde hair as her tongue battled for dominance in the small girl's mouth .  As they kissed , Rikku moved her knee back so that she was straddling Yuna and slowly lowered her hand .  First tracing Yuna's figure down her side , then her hips , and finally under her dress .  She found what she was looking for and softly rubbed her finger against the damp fabric , making Yuna clench Rikku's hair in her hand tightly . \
  "  Oh Rikku ! Just do it ! I can't take anymore !  "   Yuna found herself begging .  Rikku's heart pumped wildly as she nodded and moved down Yuna's body towards her dress .  She didn't bother taking the dress off , simply scooting it up so she had easy access to Yuna's tempting sex .  She then leaned in and shifted the fabric aside .  There it was .  Something she had been longing to see , but never thought she'd see it this close .  Rikku almost cried tears of joy and dove right in , lapping up the wetness that coated Yuna's quivering clit , and enjoying every drop like water in a desert .  Yuna's moans grew loud at that point and she clenched Rikku's hair tighter in one hand , while clawing at the ground with the other . \
  "  Oohhh ! Oh god Rikku ! Dont stop !  "   Yuna moaned , on the edge of screaming .  For some reason just about everything Rikku did felt so much better than Tidus .  Tidus .  .  . what would be say if he found out ?\
  "  Aahhh !  "   Yuna suddenly screamed as she felt two of Rikku's thin fingers slip past her defenses and into her slick caverns , interrupting whatever thoughts she had and putting them to rest . \
Rikku licked with determination , deeply savoring Yuna's womanly musk , and explored the extents of Yuna's inner walls with her fingers , getting more and more moans of ecstasy out of the Summoner as she did so .  Rikku couldn't believe what was going on .  Never in her wildest dreams did she think she'd ever actually get to have sex with Yuna ! But here she was bringing her beloved cousin closer and closer to an orgasm .  As she did , her wetness started to soak through her panties , now dampening her green shorts as well .  This much hotness was just too much for her . \
Yuna almost cried out in desperation when Rikku removed her tongue and fingers suddenly , and when she was so close too .  She opened her tightly shut eyes to see a marvelous sight .  Rikku was facing away from her and slowly pulling down her tiny shorts , giving Yuna a full view of Rikku's curvaceous butt , complete with an orange thong .  The sight made Yuna so much hornier than she currently was .  Just as she thought it couldn't get better , Rikku slid the thong down her legs as well , her dripping cunt glistening in the moonlight like the lake next to them . \
  "  Rikku .  .  .  I never realized just how pretty you were .  .  .   "   Yuna muttered , now rubbing at her own clit while watching her cousin strip .  Rikku said nothing and simply walked over Yuna's body and kneeled directly over Yuna's face , placing that luscious ass she just witnessed directly in front of her . \
  "  Yunie please .  .  . I need it too .  .  .   "   Rikku begged .  Yuna smiled graciously and placed her hands on Rikku's sexy backside before sending her tongue on an exploration of Rikku's privates . \
  "  Aahhh ! Oh god Yunie , that's it ! Lick me !  "   Rikku moaned she felt her cousin's tongue plunge into her depths and all around her soaked clit .  Rikku didn't hesitate and leaned back over to slide Yuna's panties off completely and continue pleasing her dear Summoner , now getting them in a sixty nine position .  Sexual moans and eager slurps filled the night air as Rikku and Yuna lovingly fingered and ate each other out with a rapidly growing intensity .  As they did , both girls grew louder and hornier . \
  "  Oh god Rikku yes ! Fuck me harder ! Oh god don't stop !  "   Yuna moaned and screamed . \
  "  Mmm ! Do me Yunie ! Fuck me ! Oh god ! Uuhhh ! Harder ! Faster !  "   Rikku yelled out in pleasure . \
They continued their rapid sex until .  .  . \
  "  Oh Rikku right there ! Yes ! I'm gonna cum ! Oh fuck ! I'm cumming ! AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH !  "  \
  "  Yes Yunie Yes ! I'm almost there ! God keep going ! That's it , you're making me cum ! AAAAHHHHHHHHHH !  "  \
The girls both let out screams of delight as they brought each other to climax .  After they lapped up the liquids , Rikku rolled off of Yuna and laid next to her , both of them panting and covered in each other's sex juices .  After a moment of rest , Yuna began to speak . \
  "  Rikku .  .  . we need to talk about this .  .  .   "   She said .  Rikku's eyes went wide .  She still loves Tidus , she thought .  That means she may never get another opportunity .  Rikku wasted no time and quickly got on top of Yuna again . \
  "  Rikku ! What are you doing ?  "   Yuna asked out of surprise .  Rikku placed a finger on Yuna's lips to hush her . \
  "  Yunie , just let me have this one thing please ! We've already done so much , so what's a little more right ! ? Please ! Just a little more !  "   Rikku begged , feeling tears well in her eyes .  Yuna saw just how badly she wanted this and slowly nodded .  Rikku squealed with excitement and immediately proceeded to strip the rest of Yuna's clothes off of her , followed by her own .  Yuna looked at her in confusion as Rikku took her hand and began walking towards the water . \
  "  Rikku .  .  . what are we doing ?  "   Yuna asked . \
  "  Well , I said I wanted what you gave Tidus .  I meant all of it , meaning doing it in the water too .   "   Rikku responded .  Even if Yuna was going to choose Tidus over her , there was one way Rikku would be able to accept it .  Tidus and Yuna's night in the lake was special , and will always be their first time .  So if Rikku and Yuna's first time was also in that same lake , but Rikku did it BETTER .  .  . then every time Yuna thought about her and Tidus' first time , she would remember Rikku .  She would remember that Rikku did it better .  That would let Rikku accept it .  Knowing that Yuna would have to think of how much better Rikku was every time she thought of that night . \
Rikku pulled Yuna into the water .  It was cool to the touch , but not overly cold .  Enough to make their nipples hard , but not enough to make them uncomfortable at all .  Once they were about chest deep , Rikku pulled Yuna towards her for another deep , passionate kiss , filling Yuna's mouth with her tongue , and trying to leave as much of her taste in Yuna's mouth as possible .  She began to sensually caress Yuna's whole naked body just as she saw Tidus do last night .  Whenever Yuna saw this lake , Rikku wanted her to remember HER taste , not Tidus , HER touch , not Tidus . \
Rikku took her time caressing and kissing all of Yuna's upper body , savoring every soft touch and taste , imprinting it all in her mind so she would never forget what it was like .  She moved her hand down between Yuna's legs , where she could feel Yuna's warm fluids leaking out and joining with the rest of the lake .  She rubbed at the entrance tauntingly , while making sure Yuna was close enough so every small moan and sigh she made was directly in Rikku's ear , giving her the hunger to continue . \
  "  Oohhh Rikku .  .  . yes .  .  .   "   Yuna moaned softly .  Rikku smiled , knowing that she was succeeding in her goal of performing better than Tidus .  Tidus seemed to move too quickly , too eagerly , and too carelessly .  It's almost like he just wanted the sex , and didn't appreciate her .  Rikku was taking her time .  She was making sure every single moment sent Yuna into absolute bliss . \
Yuna began to enjoy Rikku's teasing at her needing entrance and decided to return the favor , slipping her own hand between Rikku's smaller legs and feeling her slickness . \
  "  Oh Yunie .  .  . oh yes , touch me .  .  .   "   Rikku moaned , grateful as all hell that Yuna was just as into it as she was .  Wanting more , Rikku slipped a couple fingers inside her cousin , feeling the warm velvet walls enclose around them . \
  "  Haahh ! Oh god Rikku .  .  .   "   Yuna moaned as she entered her .  Rikku pushed her fingers in as far as they would go , spreading them apart to give Yuna a feeling of fullness inside of her . \
  "  Nnggh ! God Rikku , yes !  "   Yuna moaned louder in response to Rikku's expert finger work .  Not wanting to fall behind , Yuna pulled Rikku closer , pushing her tongue into Rikku's mouth and her fingers into Rikku's womanhood . \
  "  Mmmff ! Fuck Yuna ! Give it to me !  "   Rikku found herself yelling , catching herself off guard with just how badly she craved Yuna's touch .  Yuna on the other hand didn't seem to mind , in fact only obeyed and pushed her fingers farther into Rikku , plunging her depths rapidly with her soft and masterful fingers . \
Yuna and Rikku withdrew their fingers before too long and pulled each other closer and intertwined their legs , using the weightlessness granted to them by the water to get into a scissoring position while still standing .  Slowly at first , they began rubbing their soaked clits against each other . \
  "  Oh God Rikku ! You feel so good .  .  . oh God Yes , don't stop !  "   Yuna moaned in ecstasy . \
  "  Aahhh ! Oh Yunie ! Fuck me Yunie ! Oh my god yes .  .  .   "   Rikku moaned loudly , grinding her womanhood against Yuna's harder and at a faster pace .  Their pace quickened more and more , sending splashes and ripples throughout the water , and causing them to make louder and more numerous noises until .  .  . \
  "  Fuck me Rikku ! Yes ! Oh god yes ! You feel so good ! Oh I'm cumming !  "  \
  "  Oh Yunie ! Oh Yunie ! Do me ! Keep going ! Uuhhh fuck ! I'm gonna cum ! Oh Yuna !  "  \
  "  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH !  "   The teenagers screamed as they climaxed , squirting each other's clits with their juices , and mixing it with the lake's water .  Afterwards they drew each other in for another long kiss , savoring the tastes of each other . \
Once back on shore , Yuna and Rikku tugged their clothes back on .  Rikku felt satisfied .  She knew she could never have Yuna for good , but she also knew Yuna could never again think of how her and Tidus ended up together without also thinking about how Rikku devastated her more than Tidus could even hope to .  However the thought still occurred to her that she couldn't BE with Yuna .  .  . and that's what she wanted more than anything . \
  "  Rikku .  .  .   "   Yuna called out , stopping Rikku's thoughts in their tracks . \
  "  Yea , Yunie ?  "   Rikku responded , dreading what she was about to say and not daring to turn to face her . \
  "  This was so wrong .  .  . what we did .  .  .   "   Yuna started , making Rikku's heart sink into her stomach .    "  I mean .  .  . we're cousins ! And I'm almost 18 , while you're only 15 .  Even if this was okay , it wouldn't be for long .   "  \
Rikku could feel her chest hurting , as if her heart was literally breaking in two . \
  "  But .  .  .   "   Yuna continued ,   "  The mere thought of not doing it again makes my heart ache .  Rikku , I never realized it , but I think I love you .  .  . so much .  Even more than Tidus .  .  .   "  \
Rikku turned finally to look at Yuna in shock .    "  Yunie ! Does that mean .  .  .   "  \
Yuna interrupted ,   "  I don't know what it means Rikku .  .  . I love you so much , but this is wrong ! I just don't know what I want !  "   Yuna yelled before running off ahead in tears . \
Rikku held her hand out towards Yuna as if she was trying to stop her , but her feet wouldn't budge and she simply fell to her knees .  She didn't feel the tears escaping her eyes , but she saw them hit the ground .  Her body was numb and her head felt tingly . \
  "  I .  .  . I made her cry .  .  . Yuna .  .  .   "   Rikku sobbed to herself .  The person she loved most in the world was confused and distraught to the point of despair , and it was her fault . \
  "  Damn it Rikku ! Why couldn't you just leave it alone and ignore her ! ? Now look what you did !  "   She shouted .  She sobbed and sat on the ground , weeping heavily into her arms .  She cried for a few moments , regretting what she had done and how conflicted she made Yuna feel .  After a while though , she stood . \
  "  I have to tell her I'm sorry .  .  . I have to make this right !  "   Rikku said to herself and took off towards the INN . \
Lyn tossed and turned in her sleep .  There was no shelter form these dreams\'85\
The bandits came , pitch black night their cover , their life force almost .  If they made a single sound , the entire Lorca village would rise up to destroy them .  These nomads were no trifle , and scary to boot .  Lyndis was asleep .  Her father was awake , looking across the fire at his wife .    "  So\'85 What do you think ? Should we take her there ? Or should we let them come to us ?  "  \
The voice from behind the tent's wall was loud , angry , full of hate , and a lust for what the mercenary did best .    "  You let us escort her to the afterlife .   "   The Beast leapt through the wall , his axe raised high , and with a mighty sweep , he cleaved Lyndis' mother in two .  Her father screamed at the top of his lungs rousing the entire village .    "  TO ARMS !  "   he yelled . \
Lyndis awoke , and was shoved away by her father .    "  RUN LYNDIS ! RUN !  "   And run she did , no clue of what was happening .  Ten others , all fairly young , went with her , they ran , and hid in a place only the Lorca knew of , a small tent hidden in a forest alcove .  They waited there , for someone to get them .  Then they left with the morning light , to see if the village was still at war .  They saw the carnage .  No survivors . \
The flood of their pattering feet and tears rang across the Lorca's plains that day .  They cried for fallen family and friends , but not Lyndis .  She was to\'85 enraged .  She grabbed up an iron blade , the very one her father had used to fell so many of the Taliver , their yellow clothing giving the bandit gang away .  She fell to her knees , and screamed , the bloodcurdling cry would make even the stoutest hearted man go weak at the knees .  She called out to her Fellow Lorca , and held a meeting .    "  We will each of us go different ways , and each of us learn to fight .  We will become the strongest on the plains .  When you feel you are ready , gather up your allies , and try to destroy the Taliver .  Leave not a one of them alive .   "   She said , and each one of the last of the Lorca nodded , turning about , and walking off .  Lyndis walked back to the tent , and began to cry . \
Her first true tears of grief . \
Lyndis woke with a start .    "  AHH !  "   She panted , the light blue nightgown she had on offered little protection from the cold night air , and she stoked the fire again , bringing the crackling embers back into a small blaze .  She curled into herself , her eyes buried in her knees .  Less than 4 days ago , she had a family , friends , and a purpose that didn't involve slaughtering an entire group of men . \
Now she had nothing , but a wretched sword .  Nothing at all .  She screamed , and walked out side , preparing to scream up at the horse lords , to ask them why they were so cruel .  But then she saw him , a young man , possibly only 15 , maps scattered about him .  He was lying face down in the fields .  She quickly ran to him , and flipped him over , checking him for wounds\'85 none .  She then held his forehead , a slight fever\'85 probably just exhausted .  The cold air was making the blood sink into her flesh , giving her a very pale complexion . \
The man awoke .  If only for a short time , he could see .  A woman , a blue , almost silky nightgown , her pale skin backlighting the gown perfectly .    "  An\'85 .  Angel ?  "   he asked to no one , and fainted again . \
He was hallucinating , Lyndis thought .  She scooped him up , and glanced off in the distance , a Ger was rolling this way .  'Damn , when will the horselords let me wake up from this dream ?' she thought , and carried the man back into the tent hidden by the forest . \
\
Kai Awoke to see\'85 nothing .  Then he heard a voice .    "  Oh , hello , you just woke up I presume ? My name is Lyn ; I'm pleased to meet you .  I found you out on the grass outside\'85 you must have been exhausted , but I'm impressed , you overcame your fever in less than a night .   "   He looked about , and the first thing he laid eyes on was a leg , visible through a hip high slit in a dress , attached to one of the most beautiful things he had ever laid eyes on , this woman named Lyn , a Blue haired beauty with a sleek shape .  He gawked for a moment . \
\
  "  My name is Kai , many thanks for saving my life .   "   She held up her finger , listening to the wind .    "  Something wrong ?  "  \
  "  The Ger\'85 they made a lot of progress last night .   "   She heard the call of stop , and the wheels stopped creaking .  She dashed outside , and growled .    "  Damn .  That Batta\'85 A cruel bandit .  He's here to plunder , I guess\'85  "  \
Kai frowned .    "  I cannot help you combat him , but I can help you in other ways .  Allow me to accompany you .   "  \
Lyn frowned .    "  You can't even use a simple blade !  "  \
Kai frowned as he stared at the woman .    "  No , I deplore entering any sort of combat .  I've had my share of it , I am an apprentice tactician .  I create battle plans , and strategies for those who do fight .   "  \
  "  But I'm only one person\'85  "  \
Kai smirked .    "  Four can hold off an army of 150 with proper planning , and you're holding the sword wrong also .  Your grip is to loose , a good whack to that blade and it's gone .   "  \
Lyn looked at him , maybe he was right after all , and it couldn't hurt anyway .    "  Alright , come on .   "  \
They stood together , watching Batta and his lone servant setting up camp .  Batta let lose his war cry .    "  I AM BATTA ! ANY WHO DARES TO DEFY ME SHALL FALL TO MY AXE !  "  \
Lyn giggled , as did Kai .    "  A bit Melodramatic , don't you think ?  "  \
Kai thought for a moment .    "  I prefer cheesy , or corny , but melodramatic works .  Let's see here\'85 we need to close the distance .   "  \
Lyn nodded , and took off at a fast pace , her hand itching to bleed the men in front of her .  Kai grabbed her by the dress , and pulled her to the ground , making her emit a sound of some strange origin .    "  Get down ! We must not let them see us , or else we lose the element of surprise .  Look , here comes that servant\'85 stand up , be ready to fight , he will not attack first , seeing as like most bandits , he will admire your leg . \
Lyn was confused a bit by this , and cocked a brow , but did stand , pushing her legs a bit farther apart than usual .  The effect of the skin she was showing was easily apparent in the brigand's lustful face .    "  Batta would die to have a prize like you , wench .   "  \
Kai was a bit nostalgic , able to see the inside of her thighs from here , but no more\'85 Any fifteen year old would have found himself running to the nearest private back alley for relief .  Kai just simply trudged on .    "  On my mark , cut across his stomach , watch his axe , when it goes to his side , cut him in two , and be quick about it .   "  \
The brigand stepped closer , and Lyn began to realize something , her entire body could be a weapon , if she needed it to be .  She smirked .    "  What's a big old man doing with that axe like that ? Is he afraid of little old me ?  "  \
The brigand seemed to consider something .  Only sluts or women who could fight knew how to tempt a man like that .  Either one was fine with him .  He knew how to fight anyway , and it would make dispatching Batta easier .  She smiled as he came closer , inwardly anticipating the moment that he broke his stance . \
The brigand did so , but only as he was reaching out to touch the soft thigh he had been eyeing .  Kai Inwardly growled , Lyn was this easy ?\
Lyn then surprised everyone around her , the blade came out so fast , and the brigand barely had time to escape with both halves of his body .  He jumped towards the girl who had cut him across his stomach so deeply that he now bore a scar on his ego also , aiming to cut her arms off . \
Lyn quickly sidestepped , but that didn't stop the brigand's attack , he turned , his axe's flat side coming around to bust her in her side . \
The attack was so\'85 unexpected that Lyn was hit by it hard , flying to the ground , grabbing her side in pain . \
The brigand was glad .  He didn't cut that beautiful skin , and bruises fade .  He would take his prize here and now .  One hand idly strayed to his pants while his axe hung idly at his side , as he walked to Lyn's prone form . \
  "  NOW LYN !  "   Kai yelled , and Lyn knew it was the mark .  She thrust her sword up and forward and soon found herself a phallus shish kabob on the end of her sword , and she quickly lifted the blade , cutting open the brigand's stomach , and slammed her boot into his nut , flinging him off the blade as the rank smell of rotting meat emanated from his now gutless body .  She stood up , quivering .    "  Kai\'85 You have my knapsack , give me the Vulnerary .   "   Kai did as he was told , then frowned , he was the one following orders now !\
She drank half of the liquid , and then poured the rest onto the wound she had received , the large , black bruise would have been horrifying , if Kai had actually seen it , but , he had turned to spare Lyn her modesty .  He watched Batta , nearly snoozing on his throne .    "  Alright , Lyn , I have a plan\'85 save a little of that though .   "  \
Lyn looked at the empty bottle .    "  Oops .   "   She said quietly , and giggled .    "  Too late .   "  \
Kai nearly collapsed .  A Novice warrior and an apprentice tactician , that was all they were , how were they supposed to win now , against a Seasoned Brigand !\
Kai turned on his heal , only to be blinded by the light shining off the now bloodstained iron sword .    "  That's it ! Quickly Lyn , listen , we have no time to lose .  You will stay as low as possible , and follow the draws on the plane , until you are within ten to thirty paces of Batta .  Then you will rise , and challenge him , as he rises , hold your sword up to the sky , and lean it back a little\'85 try to reflect the light into his eyes , and when he is blinded by it , quickly strike at any part you can that would injure his ability to fight , arms , legs , or even kill him .  The choice is yours .  I'll just stay here and watch .   "  \
Lyn nodded .  She dashed off , for some reason , trying to prove herself to the stranger .  She smiled , fifteen paces was as close as she could get , but the draw was sharp , she could easily surprise the sleeping Brigand .  But she choose not to .    "  Well well Batta , it's time for you to die .   "  \
Batta smiled behind closed eyes .  His rotted teeth gave off a foul stench as he talked .    "  Not before I strip you , and make you my concubine .   "   He said , and stood , towering over Lyn .  She was\'85 in a strange fighting stance . \
  "  Is Batta so underappreciated that they send a little girl with a pig sticker to negotiate with him ? HA ! BATTA THE BLOODY IS UNSTOPPAB- ARGH !  "  \
The light hit him square in the pupils , and she leaped .    "  KYA !  "   She yelled , her sword cleanly severing the blinded giant's arm .  Then she turned ; her blade sinking hilt deep into the bottom of his jaw .    "  Batta\'85 Shut up .   "   She said , and jerked the sword out , spraying blood and bone fragments , not to mention teeth , away from the bloodied mass of what was once a word-hole and breathing hole .  She had not a drop of blood on her , nor any bones or the like as she walked back to Kai . \
\
Lyn stood over the cook pot stove .  It had been hell for Kai to convince her to stay at the tent for one more day , before they set out to sell off the loot they got from Batta's Ger .  Then , he had said something that earned him a rather large lump .    "  And besides\'85 A lady is not supposed to be a warrior , they are supposed to stay home and clean\'85  "  \
\
-WHAM-\
The lump was painful and swollen .  He had apologized , but the fuming girl looked like she was going to use that sword on him .  He was damn glad she didn't .  He hadn't even finished his sentence .  He sat there , wincing , his head was pounding .  He watched her cook , and even though he was focusing on his feet , the farthest thing from his head , and his pain , he couldn't think of anything but what dreadful circumstances she had lived though .  He sighed for her , and continued to watch his feet , oblivious to the sweet aroma of her cooking .    "  I'm going outside .   "   He said , and stood , his feet quickly carrying him that way . \
As he stepped outside , he pointedly made his way to the place where he could see Lyn's shadow .    "  A saying in my home country Lyn .  The best laid plans are the worst laid traps , and one is never better than his adversaries , only more skilled .  No mission is the most holy , and no mission is the most evil .  Each has his reason , and each has his wants .  All missions are based on opinions .   "   And he walked a little farther away from the tent , and then stopped .    "  By the way , the last part of what I was saying before\'85 Unless they have a god given mission of revenge or to protect her child .  In that case , I completely condone killing and even outright murder .  Blood for Blood , Life for Life .  As it is from the ash of the fallen that the new ones are born to become ash again , it is the old ones , who place the new ones in the ground to become ash .   "   He sighed .    "  But pay me no mind .  The dreams which must torture you so are nothing compared to my guilt , my angst\'85  "  \
Lyn ran out as she heard him walking away from the Tent .    "  Come back Kai , you haven't eaten ; besides , you're getting your cut of the gold .   "   Kai continued walking .    "  How did you know about my dreams ?  "  \
Kai stopped\'85 how had he known about them ? Was it that look in her eyes ? The fact that she had something in common with him ? He didn't care ; he truly didn't give two shits about this woman , just another beauty .  He turned around and looked in her direction , pulling out something out of his satchel .  He looked at it , and peered through the center hole .  It began to glow as he pointed it at Lyn .  He remembered his father's last words . \
  "  This seal will guide you to your destiny .  When it glows\'85 Your life awaits .  You are twined in the fate of destiny it's self .  Go to Sacae .  Find the one whom the heaven seal reacts too .  Use it when you\'85 leave\'85  "  \
That's what father had meant .  His destiny called .  He turned around and walked back towards Lyn .    "  I will be your loyal tactician , and friend , if you permit me , my Lord .   "  \
Lyn smiled , and then went inside , happy for the company , and glad to eat . \
Kai was also happy .  He had found his destiny . \
Kai awoke , and stretched , the lady in a nightgown beside him was still asleep .    "  Lyn\'85  "   he said . \
Lyn sprung awake , flipping out of the bed , and quickly changing right in front of Kai .  The blushing teen kept quiet , watching the older lady dress quietly . \
Kai stood up , slowly slipping into his green and brown robes .  He turned around , and stared at Lyn , who was having her turn to blush .    "  I didn't see a thing\'85  "   he said , and took his first step away from the tent .  Lyn followed , her plains bred horse carrying the pack they had of their items . \
The team stepped lightly , venturing over the hills of Sacae , until they saw Bulgar , the foremost , and largest , city in all of Sacae .  The quickly marched down the hill , a companionable silence had been kept the entire way down .  The lands surrounding them were hills , farms , and mountains , though far off ones .  The Mountains of Bern were a favorite place for bandits to live , so Bulgar was placed well away from them . \
As soon as they stepped into town , they passed many tribesman , some bowing to Lyn , others merely sneering at Kai .  Kai frowned as he walked , following behind Lyn .  When they reached a less populated area , ( Which , Ironically , was the town square ) Lyn stopped and turned around .    "  Kai , why were you behind me the whole way ?  "  \
  "  It is improper for a vassal to lead the Lord .  Besides , you are Sacaen , I am not .  I am an outsider , and do not know my way around .   "  \
Lyn smirked .    "  Okay servant .  By the by , here's the stall we sell our spoils at .  I have no clue how to use axes in a combat situation , so let's sell them first .   "  \
Kai nodded , and followed her , at her side , though a little behind , so he could watch where she went .  All the time , the heaven seal at his side pulsated , and almost seemed to warn him .  He was on edge . \
Lyn smiled at the large bag of gold she received from the merchant , and then went around , selling the rest of the spoils .  She kept the spare set of vulnerary she got from Batta's Ger . \
She smiled , and nodded .    "  You must know that we still have business to do\'85 I want to go to the shrine of the Mani Katti , the sacred sword , and say a prayer .  We will need its protection for the road ahead .   "  \
Kai nodded to this , and they started walking towards the gate .  Kai was in the lead this time , knowing the whereabouts of the gate . \
Lyn screamed loudly   "  KYA !  "   and the sound of a slap permeated the square .  A rather\'85 unorthodox looking knight had just grabbed her hindquarters , and received a blow to the face which had shaken him to the heels . \
  "  What beauty is this , with fire in her heart and legs of the goddesses !  "  \
  "  A Knight you may dress as , but a brigand you act like !  "   she said , hand fondling the hilt of her sword .    "  Where might you be from that you have the balls to treat a Sacaen woman this way and hope to keep those precious jewels ?  "  \
  "  I am form Lycia , my dear angel ! From the Caelin Canton , home to men of passion and FIRE !  "  \
Lyn twitched , finding Kai's gaze at the knight staying her hand .  He didn't want the rambunctious woman to start an all out brawl here in the town , especially when he had the reach of a spear over her sword .  He didn't care how skilled and fast she was ; a spear nearly always trumped a sword . \
  "  Well , dear knight , I can see it really means home to Shallow oafs with loose tongues .  Good day .   "   She said and turned , Kai merely smirked , and turned with her . \
Lyn was steaming , her mad face shining like a ruby in the midday light .  Kai merely patted her on the back , and said   "  They are strangers to your ways , as I am , please give them slack .   "  \
Kent walked over to the downtrodden looking Sain , his boon of a friend .  The man was a lecher , but one of the best knights he had trained with .  The large red hand print on his face was all Kent needed . \
  "  I told you Sain , idle hands are the devil's plaything , and you are the devil in this case .   "  \
  "  But it was one of the firmest I have ever had the grace to touch , invited or no ! She's fiery that one .   "  \
Kent looked at Sain's face , and followed the nearly apparent lines from his pupils to the retreating bum , swaying , the two legs shown to him by the rather\'85 odd dress were\'85 Familiar almost ! This dress\'85 he had seen Madelyn in this same dress in castle Caelin paintings . \
  "  Sain\'85 have you ever looked at the paintings on the walls of Castle Caelin ?  "  \
  "  Why , no , what for ?  "  \
  "  That was our mission !  "  \
  "  To look at Paintings ?  "   Sain scratched his head .    "  I thought we were to bring Madelyn's daughter back to Lord Hausen !  "  \
  "  She was Madelyn's Daughter ! I think\'85  "  \
  "  You've got to be kidding me ! No , her but was to firm to be Royalty !  "  \
SMACK !\
Lyn growled , Kai growled\'85 hell ; even their packhorse was growling ! They stepped towards the knights .  Even the horses had the marks of the Castle Caelin . \
Lyn glared at the , now sporting two red marks , green armored Knight .  A knight in red armor was sighing beside him .    "  Milady , I'm most apologetic for my companion's most inappropriate\'85 grasp on reality .   "  \
Lyn smirked .    "  That's funny .  I suppose there are honorable men among Lycian knights .   "  \
Kent bowed .    "  I thank you ; I must ask your name however\'85  "  \
Sain growled , and then bellowed   "  HEY ! I saw her first !  "  \
Lyn frowned .    "  I think I was wrong .  Get your horses out of the road .   "  \
Kent sighed , and nodded .    "  We will be along in a moment .  Thank you , many apologies .   "  \
Lyn nodded , and Kai followed her back out to the horses .  Kai snickered .    "  Knowing you , you should have decked them .   "  \
  "  Should have shouldn't I ?  "  \
Kai sighed , and leaned against the horse .  Then he moved his back strangely .    "  Caelin Cavaliers\'85 They would be good allies .   "  \
  "  Their minds reside between their thighs\'85 they would be to busy watching my legs to see my sword , and take credit for the hard earned kills I scored .  Besides , watching my leg is a good way to earn a lance .   "  \
Kent stood in front of Lyn now , and bowed .    "  I believe our mission here has been completed .  Would you mind traveling companions ?  "  \
  "  Yes .  I would .   "   Lyn said simply , glaring at the knight .    "  You and your Friend seem to be intent on groping me .   "  \
  "  I assure you , that is not MY intention .  I am well mannered and schooled well in the combat arts .  A woman who did not intend to fight would not have an apprentice strategist with her .   "  \
Sain stepped up now .    "  My flower , I assure you , Kent , my Boon Companion , is much too daft and serious to be interested in a woman , at any time .  However , if it is\'85\
-WHACK-\
It was Kai who slapped him this time , and obviously much harder than either of the two before him , seeing as Sain's face was buried in one of his horse's freshest patties .    "  You will show respect , the UTMOST respect , when speaking to Milady , Sir Knight .  And then you will show even more .  The more your mouth opens , the more it makes you seem like an idiot .   "   He thought for a moment , and then said   "  And , well , I'm afraid I must say , you look enough of an idiot with that ridiculous green armor .   "  \
Sain got up and growled , going to the nearest bar to wash his face , seething . \
Kent was keeping a straight face .    "  Sir Strategist , strike my friend again and I shall-\
  "  You shall do absolutely nothing , Due to the Knights Code ; one will not strike a foe that is unarmed .   "  \
Kent looked shocked .    "  FINE .  Our Horses are moved , we shall escort you shortly , I'm calling you out here , according the CAVALIER'S Code , and I'm allowed to challenge you when inside the borders of my homeland .   "  \
Kai smirked .    "  Lyn , we will head outside town , now .   "   And started walking , Lyn took one last glance at the Cavalier , and ran after Kai . \
They reached well past the outskirts .    "  Uh oh\'85  "  \
Zugu smirked , standing tall outside of his band ,   "  Well well\'85 a beauty .  Man oh man the things I won't do\'85  "  \
  "  What do you mean brigand ?  "  \
  "  Oh , I just need her skin , all for a mountain of gold .   "  \
The sound of horses charging distracted all seven of them .    "  Eh ? Who's this ?  "  \
  "  COWARDLY CURRS !  "   Sain fumed at them , glaring poison .    "  Such numbers against a lady , even for brigands , you are low !  "  \
Lyn , and Kai , were surprised at the sudden burst of knighthood from Sain . \
Kent was the next to speak .    "  If they seek a fight , they will fight me !  "  \
Zugu growled .    "  We ain't here to fight , we're here to skin that bitch and earn our gold .  Outta the way , Knights .   "  \
Kai Smirked , and stepped forth .    "  Strategist's Flare !  "   The bright magical fire that burst in front of the 4 , shoving the 5 brigands back wasn't even hot , but it produced unearthly amounts of smoke .  Kai dragged Lyn with him into a thicket , and dove down . \
  "  Knights , listen to me , they'll be disoriented , wait until they regain their bearings , they'll spread themselves thin , and we'll strike .  They want Lady Lyn's Skin ; they'll take a Blade and their own home\'85 Steer clear of Lances , brigands are excellent at fighting against lances , they're plain deadly with those axes , your horses will be in trouble .  Big trouble .   "  \
Sain Looked at Kai .    "  Why Should I believe you ?  "  \
  "  Listen , A Sword Is Narrow .  No way to block the head of a Lance without sidestepping , and Blocking something gives you plenty of time to step aside .  Even a Weak Warrior with an Axe can do serious harm to a horse , Or a Knight's Armor with even an IRON Axe .   "  \
  "  A Sword Is Light and Fast , With a Blade even longer than an Axe's Shaft and haft .  It Can Slip beneath the head of the axe and hold it there , allowing very easy dodging when you are fighting against an axe Wielder .  Besides , Most Sword Wielders have thin or no armor , to promote the Best speed .   "  \
  "  A Lance is long and Narrow , With the Smallest Blade size , but the biggest Reach .  This means it has a smaller blade than an axe , and renders it Unwieldy .  It's Good for a HARD hit , and Decent Rate of use .  A Sword has no chance against it .  The Blade is too stretched out , to long and narrow to take a firm hit from the blade .  It'd break in a moment .   "  \
The Two Knights nodded , Sound Reasoning and deep knowledge of the arts of war . \
Sain was\'85 .  Intimidated .    "  Well What If I don't have a Sword , I can still beat these Brigands !  "   And Rode off to the forest , Kent about to chase after him . \
  "  KENT ! Wait !  "   Kent did so , looking at the strategist .    "  Stick to the forests\'85 Axes and swords have trouble with Vertical hits , and lances are easy to trap inside them .   "  \
  "  Sound Words form a Sound Mind\'85 I'll be sure to tell him .   "  \
The sound of Blades echoed in the distance .  A horse Nickered , and Kai leaped up into a tree , climbing to the very top , watching the battle as it began to rage .  The smoke he had produced had dissipated .  He tossed a small object down to Lyn .    "  Wear that .  It will allow me to see things with your eyes , or anyone who follows you into battle .  These Two Knights included .  When I find a grand place for you to move , it will be illuminated in a blue light .  Anywhere within would be a good place to be .  It will also Color your foes red , I Green , and your allies Blue .  It's a Strategists Necklace .  Guard it with your Life .  I'm OBBLIGED to assist anyone with that Necklace , A Blood Bound thing .   "  \
Lyn nodded , and placed the amulet about her neck .  'I wonder if this thing actually works\'85' She thought . \
'Of course it does . ' Kai said to her through the telepathic link .  'They establish telepathic links , as well .  You mustn't have much other than combat on the mind when you wear it , I'm easily distracted .  And By the By , from your angle , you're very attractive . '\
Before she could erupt in a retaliatory outburst of rather sadistic thoughts , he shifted his focus to Sain .  Suddenly , he could see the area around Sain well .  The Ignorant Knight was wandering around in a brutally obvious circle .    "  Kent ? Uhhh\'85 Kent ? Where are you my boon companion ?  "   Kai shot his voice through Sain's head , telling him to get out of the way as a brigand leaped from behind the tree . \
The Brigand landed on Sain's horse , but felt\'85 something shove him off as hard as it could , slamming him against the trunk of the tree , as Sain's horse whinnied and slammed it's horse shoes into his chest .  The now Breathless brigand swung the flat of his blade against the incoming spear that was in Sain's hand , and shoulder bashed the knight , sending him off his horse .  Sain was Weaponless , Alone , and off his only trump card , his horse . \
He shifted his presence to Kent .  He forcibly grabbed the reins of the horse , his telepathic communications flooding Kent's mind .  'Listen , Sain is in danger , Dehorsed , Delanced , and desperately fighting against a brigand .  The brigand is slightly injured , but that fall hurt Sain , a lot , as far as I can tell .  You NEED to get to him , he's this Direction .  Hand him your spare sword .  He'll need it .  They're in the forest as well .  Remember what I told you . '\
'Aye .  I'm no stranger to a strategist's abilities .  Still unnerving though . ' Kent thought . \
'Keep your damn wits about you , this is life and death .  Lyn seems bored .  Going over to her .  Yell if you need anything . '\
His mind's Eye shifted over to Lyn .  She was currently cussing up at the completely motionless Kai in the tree , and she shivered as she felt\'85 SOMETHING near her .  'Oh hush , it's astral projection .  Now shut up and move\'85 .  Here . ' The blue light erupted into the sky .  'The knights can take care of themselves .  Though , I think you might be one vulnerary lighter in a minute . ' He floated beside Lyn as she was still cussing him .  Though he could still hear her thoughts . \
'Little pervert thinks he has a right to take over my eyes and look at me ? What's to guarantee he won't go peeping around when I'm sleeping with this damnable necklace of his ? ARGH ! Though\'85 I suppose he's too honorable for that\'85 he did complement me\'85' she slowed down to a slight jog . \
He growled at her .  'I swear , if you don't start RUNNING I'm going to yank you there by your tits , you mindless yuppie , Now RUN !'\
She didn't want to test this kid's patience . \
She cowered in the forest up north , her sword at the ready .  She didn't like this place , nor the feeling she got from it .  She watched from the shadows of the tree , glaring at the large redish colored man in the distance .  He was obviously looking for her , and not at the mercy of the necklace she wore . \
'Good , you should be safe for a moment .  I'll be assisting in the battle with Sain and Kent .  I need you to remember all the techniques you've learned so far .  A Brigand such as he will fall easily to your charms , but his flesh is tough .  You need to go for the killing stroke .  Two at most should do him in .  DO NOT leave the forest .  If you do , he won't think he took you by surprise , and will attack first .  Ambush him here . '\
Sain rolled over , scrambling backwards .    "  Stay away , you brigand ! I warn you , I can show you Pain has you have never felt before !  "   The brigand just smiled at him , hefting his axe , and jumping as high as he could\'85\
Before a Red blur flashed by him , and his arms erupted in a red spray , the brigand screaming as he felt his arms leave his body .  The single iron blade in the dust beside him prompted Sain to do his first true act of war .  With a spinning flourish of his wrist , he snapped the blade up , coming up off his hind quarters , and taking a step foreward with his back foot , around to his side , the back spinning motion of the blade , coupled with the forward motion of the brigands screaming form , severed the head from his shoulders .  The Sickening plop of a head caused Sain's stomach to lurch .    "  By the Gods , This is War ?  "   Kai's mental presence patted him on the shoulder .  'Sain , this is nothing compared to what TRUE war is .  This is just a bandit attack .  Go see Lyn .  See the Blue Pillar in the sky ? Once you head into that , call out to Lyn .  She will give you a Vulneray .  Oh , and your horse is grazing Here .  The Yellow Light shall Indicate it . '\
  "  What sorcery is this ? Lights before my eyes ? And Voices in my head ? Do the souls of the Fallen Haunt you in a war ?  "  \
'No , this is how a TRUE Strategist works .  Now Go , Complete the objectives I have given ye . '\
Kent's Horse was working up a lather .  His was a Horse Built for Rugged Walks , and Harsh mountain climbs , not hard running headlong into the grip of a brigand .  Kai Shifted over to him , and floated along side .  'Kent , I Trust you find the arms of a brigan spraying blood on your armor a comfort ? If not , please don't be so gruesome .  Go for a Killing Stroke , please , or atleast a harshly wounding one .  Incapcitaging an opponent is not what we need .  We need corpses , or Runaways .  Not Prisoners . '\
Kent sighed .  'For my frind to Receive his true blooding , it was necessary . ' he thought aloud to kai , his sword raising high as he jumped his horse , the loud whinney causing the brigand to back pedal as he tried a long overhead swing .  Kent's blade came up under the axe head , blocking the blow as it bit into the wooden haft .  The brigand did an about face as Kent's Horse landed , and he gave a short cry . \
The Horse Delivered one single back hoof smack to the brigand's brigand spilled over as Kent reared his horse up , and held his blade in a underhand grip .    "  KUNY !  "   he yelled as the horse did a short hop with it's slightly bladded back hoof shoes , snapping the shin bones of the brigand .  The horse fell down on it's front hooves , shattering the brgainds right shoulder blade , and stoping by his head as kent reared forward , delivering a single stab to the nape of his foe's neck .  Thus ended the second battle of the skirmish , and only three more remained .  All of them were high stakes gambles . \
Lyn Stood on the branch of the tree .  Kai was impressed .  'Good position .  Here comes the brigand now .  An Easy way to finish this fight would be to drop when the brigand enters the circle here\'85' he said as a simple red circle appeared .  'and kill him with a downward stroke .  A Simple stab to the head shall do it . ' Lyn nodded , and smiled as the brigand stopped just inside the circle , strangely , smiling .    "  Come out come out , Kitty Kitty\'85 This ole Wolf won't bite to hard\'85  "  \
  "  But this Kitty\'85  "   she said as she jumped from the tree , blade betwixt her legs , smiling maniacly as she tried to stab him in the head .    "  HAS CLAWS !  "   He took a sidestep to the right as Kai began to scream-think 'RUN LYN ! RUN ! GET OUT OF THERE ! AMBUSH !'\
The brigand smiled as he prepped for a massive axe swing , his axe blade swinging hard to the right .  Lyn Ducked down even further , and obstinately bull rushed her opponent , legs coiled tight as a mynx ready to pounce , she leapt up onto his body , slamming her feet into his belly as her knees slammed his chest , blowing him over as his buddy slashed vertically , the axe burying it's self right below his penis as he fell .  Lyn Dashed off into the forest , The brigands howling at each other . \
'Lyn turn back now .  Follow this path .  When they come round the bend highlighted in red , ambush them again .  No war cries , or flashing blades .  A Simple Run by strike on the rear most one's back .  Sain and Kent are on their way .  Ken is coming in from the west , Sain from the south , here , you will have a northerly attack .  Follow the yellow path to the spot designated , and prepare for another sword drop . '\
Lyn nodded , following his instructions , her heart pounding as she stopped in the brush , watching the first brigand go running by .  The second followed his buddy , at a slower pace , still gunshy of the maniac in front of him .  He nearly had his penis bisected a moment ago .  He stopped only for a moment . \
Lyn made her move .  She dashed behind him , with a spinning step , dragging her blade's edge along his back , the ribbon of blood flowing down in a razor's edge form as he screamed loudly , giving chase to her . \
She ran for all she was worth , determined to outdistance him as she lept for a branch above her .  With a kicking flip , she dropped her guard completely for one last finishing strike .  The brgand charged through the underbrush , his axe down low , unable to defend as he got a face full of blue dress , and red blood , as the blade sank into his forehead .  With a Roll , Lyn removed the blade , pulling it up through his skull , making the hole much bigger .  She looked at the grey flesh clinging to it , and smiled snidely .  She had completed her third Kill under the guidance of Kai . \
The Two Cavaliers dashed towards the Site , highlighted in blue .  Even as Lyn grew ever closer to death . \
The Reaper of the little forest patch had just become the hunted , and a birgand was falling quickly on his prey , Kai absent for a moment , unable to warn his charge .  The brigand's weight fell on her back as his axe barely missed it's mark , due to a rouge branch .  Kai shifted over to Lyn as his body began to hurt all over .  'Oh no , LYN ! Get up ! Fight back !'\
However , she couldn't muster the breath to attack .  Panic struck her like the fires of hell were burning away her life . \
Just then , A Sole Cavalier Leapt through the underbrush .  With a Glance and a Nod , Sain realized that his horse wouldn't land of Lyn , but he would fall short of the fight , with no time to save his Newest charge , He did the only thing he could do . \
He leapt off the back of the horse , his sword in his left hand , lance in his right .  The flying green dart shoved his lance out , even as the blade of the axe lanced down to Lyn's Back .  The Spear jammed into his prey's ribs , and out of his stomach , then into the ground , as his sword came up in a lashing motion , slamming the blade of the axe away from lyn , the Heavy weighted side slamming into his target's skull .  The Spear in his hand broke as he over shot his prey , but had slain it all the same . \
What Sain had failed to take into account , was his friend had just leapt through the bushes on the other side of the alcove , as he Charged to save Lyn .  The Resulting collison would have surely broken bones , had it not been for Kai's Astral form , wedged between the two of them .  This softened the impact for the two of the knights , but Kai , Ethreal as he was , was able to slightly manipulate things . \
And now he could add another to his list of Strategist's gifts .  His astral form could be Manipulated BY things . \
'OW ! Damnit ! Get offa me ! OW !' he yelled mentally , jumping up through them .  The two knights laid there , dazed and confused , as if they were just going to absolutely -DIE- from the pain .  The two horses slightly rolled their eyes , and neighed quietly , looking for their next grasstacular meal . \
Lyn sat up , rubbing her back .    "  Ooowwww ! That hurt ! WHERE IS THE BASTARD THAT DID THIS !  "  \
Both Sain and Kent looked at lyn with fear in their eyes .  The Blue haired girl was fuming .  Both Knights had faced her scorn before , and deiced thusly .    "  OVER THERE !  "   They shouted simultaneously , and dashed to their horses , leaving the ethereal kai standing before an enraged princess . \
  "  It was neither of their faults , lyn .  Infact , they have slain the man that did it to you .  The leader of these brigands is to the west .   "  \
With a smug smirk , Lyn smiled , and walked towards the west , coming near the bridge .  She laid her eyes on zugu , and with a hunter's pace , she closed the distance . \
The brigand leader's eyes were to the south .  He simply stared on at everything , almost as if he expected the attack to come from there . \
Lyn didn't take the fact for granted .  She took it for his fatal flaw .  As zugu hefted his axe up to turn in response to seeing the small blue blur , he couldn't quite notice the vague burst of stamina and speed the woman had . \
Kai suddenly realized something .  Throughout the battle , his heaven seal had continued to glow , ever brighter , but now is dim .  A Bare glow .  It had happened when Lyn had slain the first brigand .  He had felt the wave of energy erupt from the seal .  He quickly shifted his focus to kent .  It glowed almost as brightly as It had glowed after Lyn's fight with Batta , and with sain , only a little brighter .  He wondered , could It have some connection to his mental link , and his charge's troops ? He shifted his vocus back to lyn .  The stonelike item was quiet once more .  He breifley rubbed it . \
Lyn smiled , and swung her blade at Zugu .  The razor's edge of the blade scraped along the back of Zugu's axe , and the enemy leader just smiled .  As soon as the tip of te iron blade passed , he swung his own weapon wildly . \
The side of the head impacted Lyn's back , sending her foreward in a roll .  Zugu quickly ran up .  His arms splayed above his head , he leaped , aiming to cleave lyn's head in two . \
Kai felt a burst of energy within the seal , and telepathically screamed his order .    "  NOW ! ATTACK !  "  \
Lyn's eyes flew wide as she rolled onto her shoulders , and pushed off , her blade clashing into Zugu's chainmail leggings , and skiming up along his flesh .  Her she slipped through his grasp with the grace of a fish in a stream , and flipped , her blade lashing directly along her opponent's spine .  She landed on her feet with a smug smile , even as Zugu swung low and wide , aiming to hit the woman with his blade .  He smirked as he thought he had her .  In a flash of movement , lyn was at his side , pulling the blade along zugu's nose .  The bridge erupted into blood as the blade bit into his flesh .  The last thing zugu ever saw was his own expression of fear as the metallic surface slashed into his eyes .  The blade pulled away , a small ribbon of blood following the tip as the blood left the blade . \
Zugu , in his state of shock , and his tensed muscles , stood straight up , screaming as though he had been cut by a thousand needles .  Lyn simply plundged the blade into his armpit , the motion shattering the side of his skull as the tip erupted from his body .  The stubborn brigand refused to die however . \
Implaed by the deadly lass' blade , he screamed .  He could do nothing but scream , even as she jerked the blade downward , cleaving through even his chainmail leggings . \
However , lyn failed to take into account her own strength , as she jerked it about , and it cut cleanly into the brigand's head , neatly slicing the man coplyetely in two . \
Lyn took a step away and fell onto her knees as a faint gust blew into her hair .  Zugu's face hit the ground first , followed by his ass , and entrails .  Sain had just ridden up , expecting to be the hero of the battle , when he had witnessed this . \
He promptly fainted , his horse galloping through the bandit's remains , and dumping the exhausted knight into the guts of the man . \
Kent , truly disgusted by this sight , quickly dismounted , helping lyn to her walked her to his horse , and sat her down , looking away from the carnage . \
Sain felt his body lifted . \
Sain opened his eyes . \
Sain lost his lunch . \
This was what kai saw as he sat beside lyn , and wrapped her in his arms , hushing her as she strained not to sob .    "  I was\'85 Almost dead\'85 I saw them\'85 mother\'85 Father\'85 all of them\'85 pushing me away .   "  \
Kai reached down , touching the now completely quiet seal .  It was cracked . \
  "  Heaven seal\'85 .  I see\'85  "   he muttered .    "  Lyn\'85 Today was not your day to die\'85 There was no way we could have predicted this battle\'85 But you did well .   "  \
She cried .  The hard woman , who so completely embodied everything Kai admired , cried like a child .  She wept into his shoulder .    "  Shhh\'85 Hush , Lyn\'85 You are a warrior , and a princess .  You have no right to cry as though you were a babe .  You have slain a man , not in anger , but indefense of your life .  This right is sacred to all humans .  You have broken nothing , and have made no sin .  Cry not for yourself , but cry for those who were not able to defend themselves from this man's wrath .   "  \
She nodded solemenly .  Kent watched the two .  He was\'85 impressed by the woman's prowess .  But , she had died .  This , Kent knew .  Sain wandered off to puke in peace , and find his horse .  Kent nodded , and pitched a small tent , pushing some treelimbs together , he lit a fire .  Kai lay his charge down to sleep . \
The fire burned for an age , both of them , Young , but experienced knight , young , inexperienced tactician , stared at it's flames .  Kent broke the silence . \
  "  You carry a heaven seal ?  "  \
  "  What of it ?  "  \
  "  Did it crack ?  "  \
  "  Yes\'85  "  \
  "  I thought so .   "  \
  "  Why do you ask ?  "  \
  "  They can only break ten times\'85 .  And then , heaven in unsealed .   "  \
  "  How many are there\'85  "  \
  "  One , such as yours is\'85 Three others\'85  "  \
  "  So it does what I think ?  "  \
  "  Yes and no\'85 that heaven seal is special\'85 it negates your oath as a strategist\'85  "  \
  "  How so ?  "  \
  "  Unsealing heaven\'85 .  Unseals the dragons .   "  \
  "  I see\'85  "  \
  "  And the one who gave the dragon slayers to man\'85  "  \
  "  The\'85  "  \
  "  Yes .   "  \
  "  I cannot let it break then\'85  "  \
  "  The breaks only apply to those who will bear the heaven seals .   "  \
  "  I see\'85 .  And the Bloodbind amulet ?  "  \
  "  Is the trigger\'85 .   "  \
  "  I see\'85 So she is more valuable than any can know .   "  \
  "  Truly .  This is why we must prevent Lundgren from fetching her .   "  \
  "  I see\'85 So why are we marching straight into his jaws ?  "  \
  "  You have another piece to the puzzle in your mind already .   "  \
  "  The glowing ?  "  \
  "  Is heaven's energy pouring off .  It can aid your charge .  It will slowly increase their potential .  And her subordinates .   "  \
  "  I see .   "  \
  "  Heaven is unsealed to us knights\'85 Death is not an option for us .   "  \
  "  Alright .   "  \
  "  Goodnight Kai .   "   Kent said , and stood up .  He walked to his pack , and laid down .  Kai simply fell back , and merely thought .  All the while , The heaven seal pulsed slowly at his side . \
Onto the story !\
My name is Kai .  I'm an apprentice tactician with no master , other than Milady Lyn .  I have numerous gifts , and a few\'85 mystical objects at my disposal , but my combat prowess is lacking .  I can telepathically link to all who swear an oath , in any form , to my Lady Lyn .  This however , does not include those who swear to kill her .  Therefore , I cannot help milady Lyn with her personal quest , the one to destroy the Taliver bandits . \
Sain is an Aloof Knight , in ridiculous green armor .  However , his power is not undeniable , though his armor is sorely lacking in defensive capabilities , and his horse\'85 well , let's say , his stallion is more interested in Kent's mare .  Sain however , has a mind much more perverted than this .  He has a habit .  A very bad habit .  Female flesh turns him into a raging adolescent , sex crazed , perverted , teenager . \
Kent is more balanced .  He is levelheaded , and quite logical .  He is no stranger to my gifts , though magic in any form tends to unnerve him .  We all tend to be at odds , seeing as we had very\'85 unnatural meeting circumstances .  Kent however , knew more about magic than he let on . \
Lady Lyndis Caelin .  Princess of the Caelin Canton of Lycia .  She was my master , and I would follow her to the ends of hell , if need be , if only to die by her side .  Of course , the fact that she now held me , so to speak , by the balls , by possessing my blood bind amulet , I would have no choice but to follow her .  But , I also followed her out of a second debt .  I had been saved by her .  I suppose my Heaven Seal saved her once , but , I took no regard into that . \
We stopped by a small village , near the shrine of Mani Katti , the Sacred Sacaen sword .  I had done research on the blade .  Supposedly , it was originally a killing edge , that a Sacaen swordmaster used to slay beasts in the far past .  I had decided that , on the off chance , that one of the more obscure texts I had read , pointing at the owner of the blade , originally being a female of the Lorca tribe , was true ; Lyn herself might possibly be a descendant of this woman .  She certain fought with a natural grace some swordmasters would be jealous of . \
I stepped near Kent quietly .    "  Sir Kent , a moment , if you will\'85  "  \
Kent nodded quietly , and stood beside me .    "  What troubles you , Commander Kai ?  "   His eyes held a brotherly concern . \
  "  Your father\'85 was a blond haired mage , correct ?  "  \
  "  How did you know ?  "  \
  "  Lucky guess .  His name wouldn't happen to have been\'85 Lord Joseph , would it ?  "  \
  "  This is true .   "  \
  "  Ah , one of the foremost men in designing more competent ways for a strategist to command an army .  My amulet is based on one of his designs , with my father's reworking .   "  \
  "  I see\'85  "  \
  "  This , I now know , explains much .   "  \
Kent nodded solemnly , and walked back towards Sain , who was eyeing a female in the small traveling crowd closely .  Too closely .  I walked over to Lady Lyn , and picked up a basic Iron Spear .  Overpriced as they were , in Sacae , I didn't care .  We would inevitably find someone who wielded a sword soon .  I laid the money on the counter .  Then I had a brilliant idea .    "  Lady Lyn , would you like to train ?  "  \
She looked at me as though I was insane .    "  Why ? Did you not say you detested combat ?  "  \
  "  Truthfully , I know full and well how to utilize every weapon I come across .  However , I cannot even begin to comprehend battle .   "   I said ruefully .    "  I'll explain more , as we venture out of this crowd .   "  \
She nodded , and walked beside me , as I carried the lance over my shoulder , as a true soldier on the march would . \
  "  You see\'85 Strategists have so much inner magic , that outer , or external , magic can literally singe our souls .  This is why we do not fight .  Now , you heard me talk of the weakness of a sword , against a lance , and its strength against an , axe , correct ?  "  \
  "  Yes , I have , Kai .  But something still disturbs me .   "  \
  "  What would that be ?  "  \
  "  Well , some things I didn't understand .   "  \
He nodded quietly .    "  Alright .  Let me demonstrate the reason a lance is well suited for combat against a blade ?  "  \
She nodded an affirmative .  When I took a basic lance man's stance , she took hers .  I gave the nod of approval , and she rushed me . \
I simply planted the butt of my spear in the ground , and held it at arms length as her blade slammed into the iron shaft of my weapon . \
I simply took two steps back , and my spear was quickly at the ready , though I was using the blunt end .  I jammed her harshly in the stomach , pushing her back a step .  A single step foreword , and a spin of my spear , and I had the point straight in her face . \
  "  You see ? A Sword is to light .  To accurate , to effectively counter a spear .  I performed this maneuver countering a horizontal slash , you see ? By letting the counterweight of the spear's butt carry it to the ground , as I step out of range of the slash , I gain the advantage of readiness .   "  \
  "  You will eventually see that , however , I am exhibiting poor form , for blocking a vertical slash .  Try it .   "  \
Lyn nodded , and took a few steps back .  She charged in again , her sword arcing downward as she ran .  I simply pushed his spear in front of me , and pulled upward , disrupting Lyn's balance .  I then slammed her in the stomach with a harsh foot .  She bounced backwards , as I readied a thrust , once again , stopping before I struck her with another lethal blow . \
  "  This time , two things went wrong .  First , you telegraphed your attack .  I didn't say weather you had to slash down or up .  You chose down .  From your natural stance , up , would have been more opportune .   "  \
  "  The second was that I had time to hit you twice .  Surely you are faster .  The cross block is one of the fastest lance blocks usable .  However , it requires you to throw your weight around quite a bit .   "  \
I smiled , and pulled Lyn up .    "  This is all the tutelage I can give you .   "  \
A resounding thwack sounded from the market , and a green armored blur made an impact comparable to a flux spell hitting the ground , in the grassy turf .  His dazed eyes were only made more dazed as he was in an opportune space to glare up a certain woman's dress . \
I sighed , and picked this man up .    "  You idiot .  We are fleeing straight into the teeth of an enemy .  You should NOT let your hands wander like that .   "   I patted him on the shoulder armor , and gave him the spear .    "  I'm off to buy some traveling horses .  No sense in pushing your Warhorses to hard .   "  \
Kent was also at the stables of the small encampment .  He was looking over a set of four horses .    "  Do you think they would be able to travel hard ?  "  \
  "  Aye .  They would .  All sturdy , and with a decent natural clip .   "   He nodded , and forked over the gold for the horses .  He frowned .    "  It looks like hard tack and water for a while .   "   I looked at Kent , who nodded solemnly .    "  I thought ahead .  Perhaps you are a decent hand at hunting ?  "  \
  "  No , I'm afraid .  But , if I am correct\'85 Lyn would make an excellent archer .  She has very accurate movement .  In complete control of her body .   "  \
  "  True , but she wouldn't be a good hand in combat , with a bow .   "  \
  "  With her current training , yes , Kent .  But can't a Lycian learn to speak Bernian ? Or Sacaen ?  "  \
  "  True .  I suppose we could let her hunt .   "  \
  "  Then the most agile horse to her .  That one .   "   I said looked at a Sorrel who had a wizened look in his eyes . \
  "  He's not the fastest\'85  "  \
  "  But , for his strength , he is quite adequate as a hunting horse .   "  \
Kent nodded quietly .    "  Good .  It's done .  Let's head on to the shrine .  If we push these horses , we should reach the shrine before sundown tomorrow .   "  \
Lyn was busy ignoring Sain so utterly that he didn't even have the heart to grope her .    "  But Milady Lyn .  Surely you-  "  \
  "  I said you will be quiet .  I am thinking .  If you are not gentlemanly enough to allow me some privacy , I shall simply cut you in two .   "  \
He gulped .  And then he spotted Kent eyeing the pair with suspicious eyes .  Kai was calmly knocking an arrow in a bow in his hands . \
  "  Sain .  Dismount .  You are to ride the paint over here .  Kent , the Young mustang .  Lyn , The Old Sorrel , and I shall ride this Roan .   "  \
Sain frowned .    "  The Paint ? He's no more than a pup !  "  \
  "  But , he is the second strongest , and the most enduring one of the lot .   "  \
  "  Ah .   "  \
  "  Kent chose the mustang because of its qualities , as a good horse to ride , simply for its staying power .  It's by and far not the fastest of the four , but it gets the job done .   "  \
  "  I chose the roan because of its speed .  He is fast , but built for very quick sprints .  Not as fast as Bernian Wyvern Runners , but , quick enough .   "  \
  "  The Sorrel for Lyn , Because of its Strength , and speed .  The strongest , and only the second fastest .  Excellent for Hunting .  Which , if anyone wants meat , they will have to wish Lyn luck for .  The bow is for you .  It's not for combat use .  It's a simple Hunter's bow .   "  \
Lyn nodded .    "  I've used them before .  I am a fair hand at hunting small game .  Perhaps bigger game will be easier to fell now .   "  \
  "  Most likely .  We should set out .  We want to be far from a village , if bandits attack once more .   "  \
  "  True .  Hostages wouldn't be a nice thing .   "  \
The venture over the plains was held at a decent little clip .  Kai munched on a small piece of hard tack , and smeared a little of his only comfort on it .  Bernian Mustard . \
Kent watched with horrified eyes .    "  How can you eat Bernian Mustard , on hard tack ?  "   Kai just smiled at him .    "  By ignoring the fact that the Tack tastes better than the mustard .   "  \
Sain sighed .    "  You know what Bernian mustard is made of ?  "  \
  "  Coming from your mouth Sain ,  "   Lyn said , with a quirky smirk ,   "  It's likely to be made of condensed wyvern seed , and the scent of sex .   "  \
Sain looked at her .    "  How did you know ?  "  \
Every horse stopped , every human save Sain half frowned , half smirked .  Sain's horse bucked him off on the ground , and every human simply laughed . \
Kent broke the laughter first .    "  Sain , you do know that it's made of Halbornus Peppers , Mustard Seed , Imported straight from Caelin , and of course , Water and salt , correct ?  "  \
  "  No ! I'm serious ! They put wyvern seed in it ! The Wyvern fruit tree !  "  \
Every human looked guilty at each other .  Lyn had a slight blush ; Kai had a look of pure guilty disgust at himself , and Kent\'85 Well , Kent just looked guilty . \
  "  We were talking about\'85 a different kind of Wyvern seed .   "  \
Sain mounted his horse , and huffed .    "  Disgusting , sir Kai .  Everyone knows wyvern seed is toxic to humans ! And if you do happen to survive the implantation , which is physically impossible , the child born to you would be half wyvern , half human ! Such Blashphemic sayings should not cross your lips .   "  \
Kent couldn't resist as they stared trotting along again .    "  And what about the smell of sex ?  "  \
  "  Ah , that's because the most favorite style of Bernian mustard , Wyvern fire , is made in the same room that the Owners of said establishment , hold their nightly forays .   "  \
It was no secret that Bernian were perverts , beyond belief , even .  But , even so , Sain's knowledge of Bern was a bit unnerving .    "  How would a Lycian Knight know much about the Militant Bern country , hum ?  "  \
Sain sighed .    "  I lost my virginity to a wyvern rider by the name of Lucia , Deep in the Bern territories when I was thirteen .  Why shouldn't I oblige a woman who had just eaten the root of a lusiy Bush ?  "  \
Lyn looked at Sain .    "  What does it do then ?  "  \
  "  It's an aphrodisiac , but very nutritional .   "  \
  "  Wrong .   "   The female said solemnly .    "  It's a Root that drives the consumer into a mad lust for nine days .  It's what female wyverns eat , consistently during the mating season .  If they detect a Female who hasn't had one , a male wyvern will give it to her , as a gift , if he finds her suitable as a mate .  Obviously , her wyvern was male , and very into her . \
Sain sighed .    "  Your point being ? I merely didn't resist her advances\'85 much\'85  "  \
Kai frowned .    "  It's Logical .  The only way Sain could get into a woman's pants is to be raped by one .   "  \
Sain Blanched , while Lyn and Kent laughed softly .    "  I was not raped ! If anything , it would have been me , taking advantage of her state !  "   He fumed . \
Everyone looked at him .    "  So , you raped her ?  "  \
  "  Well\'85 no\'85  "  \
Kai sighed .    "  Enough of this .  I cannot eat my disgustingly hard biscuit in peace with all this talk of hard things of another nature\'85 .  God , now I don't even want to eat it .   "  \
They all laughed at that , as Kai took another bite of biscuit , eliciting Lyn to raise her eyebrow .  Kai returned it with a glare that wilted the grass beyond Lyn's head . \
The sunlight was beginning to sink beyond the mountains of Bern .    "  We should rest .  This day will have taken a toll on all of our buttocks .  Lyn , would you like to try hunting ?  "  \
  "  Sure .  I see a herd of Antelius to the north .  I'll snag us one .   "  \
Kai nodded , and dismounted , unpacking the tent .    "  Then I'll set up camp .  Kent , Sain , if you would be so kind as to go fetch some firewood , I'd be much obliged .   "  \
The Calavarymen nodded , and ventured off to get the Wood , Snickering at Kai .  Kai simply sighed .  He pieced together the tent , and watched Lyn hauling a simple animal back towards them .  He smiled , and began to butcher the corpse . \
They sat around the fire , Stuffed to the brim , and overfull .  Kai was tanning the hide with a chemical solution , and stretching it taught between some stakes . \
Kent was staring up at the stars , smiling . \
Sain was off behind the Tent , doing something .  Probably reliving himself , after the large meal . \
Lyn Smiled slightly , just resting .  She yawned , and crawled into the tent with a content expression .  Kai smiled .  The Hide was curing , and he was getting tired .    "  Would someone take a watch ?  "  \
Sain hollered from behind the tent calmly   "  I will !  "   He thought he vaguely heard some sound of pain and relief mixed , but disregarded it . \
Kent nodded .    "  The boy could sleep through a war between his pants and Bern , but , on watch , he won't sleep until the sun rises or he is relieved . \
Kai nodded , and took his place in the tent beside Lyn , glad she was clothed . \
Kai was plagued by dreams that night . \
The first , and actually , only dream he had in his fitful rest , was of a small girl , carrying a spear , followed by an extremely small wyvern .  The wyvern's Flame colored scales shimmered in the moonlight , as Kai realized that it was a dracovern .  One of the few Wyverns still related close enough to Dragons to possess true flight , and Flaming breath .  But , it was still very very young .  The girl had a happy expression . \
Then he heard it .  Galloping in the distance .  The Small Wyvern-like creature bristled his fur , underneath his scales .  His scales and neck spines rose with the fur , giving him a very menacing expression . \
The pair of bandits dismounted close to them . \
The first was a tall halberdier .  His long polearm pointed at the Wyvern pup menacingly .  The second had a Dragonsword in his hands , and was tall , and built . \
The girl grabbed her wyvern protectively . \
Then he heard her voice with his ears .    "  No ! You can't take him !  "  \
Kai Jumped up , grabbing the only weapon he personally kept .  A Simple Katar .  He split it apart , and strapped both pairs on , dashing towards the girl's startled scream .    "  NOO ! NO ! GARNET ! NO ! Don't take my friend ! He's all I've got ! Please ! No !  "  \
Kai frowned .  The halberdier had stepped to the beast's side .  He grabbed it by the base of its stubby wings , and grinned . \
  "  Did you not hear the girl ?  "   Kai said quietly .    "  Touch the wyvern again\'85  "   He said as a small flare began to brew in his mind .    "  And I will kill you both before you can take your next breath of clean air\'85  "  \
The Bernian man , a Hero of a long passed Skirmish stared at the man in his greenish robes .    "  What's a Strategist going to do ? Take the Wyvern , Kilo .  Tamnu Shall deal with this one !  "  \
Kai growled , and shouted with force   "  Strategist's blaze !  "  \
A Wave of Flames , as hot as the hells themselves , appeared about the halberdier , trapping him in place .  Then he dashed towards the Hero .  With a jump , he leaped onto the blade of the sword , his tabi protecting him for the split second it took his to take the last step , and appear on the other side of the hero , two small slashes appearing on his foe's face , trailing a falling ribbon of blood to the Strategist's katar . \
Blood seeped out around the wounds , and slowly , his head fell in pieces , thankfully hidden from the young woman's eyes by his shield . \
The blaze had begun to recede , and Kai rolled backwards , slamming his feet into the Halberdier's Face , propelling him backwards\'85\
Into the waiting fangs of a youthful wyvern , who bit cleanly through the arm of the Halberdier , Eliciting a sharp scream .  Then , he was silenced , as the wyvern bit into the man's chest , crushing the armor , and breaking his ribs instantly , before puncturing his heart . \
The wyvern tossed the thing aside and clumsily galloped to his charge , of sorts , and twining his tail about her leg , and huddling close to her , hissing low at the strategist . \
Kai bowed before the wyvern , his face touching the ground in respect .  Having been raised in Bern , he slowly Raised , and crawled towards the wyvern , putting his head under the beast's face . \
  "  If my life you desire , Wyvern , you may take it .  If my friendship you Desire , Lord Wyvern , please , bring yourself and the young mistress to my camp .   "  \
He said quietly .  He backed off before standing , with his back turned to the wyvern .  All respect had been shown to the pup , and his woman , but he still had doubts .  If the wyvern didn't come , it would be the loss of a powerful ally . \
But he heard the Wyvern cooing softly to the woman , as if asking her permission .  She sat down sidesaddle on the youngling's back , and rode the small beast towards the strategist . \
Kai Felt the heaven seal pulse .  He put a hand on the seal , and nodded .  The crack had gotten slightly better , but was still present .    "  Thank you , Mistress of the Wyvern , and Lord Wyvern .   "  \
Once more , Honorifics were needed .  Kai sighed quietly , and stepped near the dwindling fire , looking into Sain's eyes .  Sain had watched the entire thing , in the glow of the firelight , caused b the blaze .  He had been fetching his spear as the sound got nearer , but was unsure to wake the others . \
He nodded at the pair of them , The Wyvern and Lady , as they neared . \
  "  Master Kai , I see you brought the two under attack back to camp\'85  "   He said as Kai put away his katar with a sigh .  He could see the young strategist crying .    "  Master Kai , Please , not in front of the guests .  It is near Dawn , you see\'85 We will journey soon .  Shall I wake the others ?  "  \
Kai nodded , before walking into the inky blackness , and sitting down , weeping with all his might .    "  I can't do this any more\'85 I can't ! I don't have the soul for it\'85 Please , Whatever Deity can see me ! Just\'85 JUST TAKE ME AWAY !  "  \
He stared at the sky , for almost half an hour as he noticed sunlight creeping towards him .  He sighed .  He wiped his eyes , and steeled himself for the day ahead . \
Kent was showing the utmost Respect to the Wyvern , Trying to stroke it , to show it no threat was meant .  The Wyvern had an Expression of withheld hostility . \
Lyn was chatting with the woman , who looked like she was half Sacaen , in descent . \
He tapped Sain on the back , who nodded .    "  I'm not as perverted as you think , Lord Kai\'85  "   he said as Kai glared at the slap mark .    "  I woke Lady Lyn up as I tripped over Kent .   "   Kai nodded .    "  Thanks for allowing me my time .   "  \
  "  You're not going to help us in combat , then ?  "  \
  "  My soul couldn't handle the tension , of that .  Besides , my gifts are better prepared as a strategical thing .   "  \
Sain nodded , and walked to the horses .  The secret was between men , and only the young Wyvern and Wyvern master knew , outside of the two .  For some reason , he felt he had nothing to fear from them . \
Kai Knelt down beside Lyn and the girl . \
  "  Milady Lyn ? How are you doing this morning ?  "  \
  "  Wonderful ! It seems Sir Sain saved this girl and her pet in the night .   "   The girl looked at Kai with apologetic eyes , glancing at her Wyvern .  Kai nodded solemnly .  Her eyes brightened a bit .    "  May I ask your Name , miss ?  "  \
  "  It's Ariana .  Ariana Wyvern .   "  \
  "  Ah .  A Wyvern Princess .  I thank you for your company .  Would you like to journey with us ? We are headed to the shrine of Mani Katti .   "   He said , nodding to her . \
She nodded .    "  I will .  You are Kai , the Strategist , correct ? And this is Lady Lyn , Kent is trying to pet Garnet , my Wyvern , and Sain was the green armored demon I saw in the night , last night .   "  \
Kai smiled .    "  He is no demon , he was just lucky , last night .   "   He said pointedly . \
She nodded .    "  Well , Then , I guess I should venture with you .   "  \
He smiled , and mounted his horse as Kent packed the tents .  Kai rode to the site of the battle , and picked up a spear from the Corpse of the Halberdier , and wiped the blood clean .  He brought it back to Ariana , and handed it to her .    "  Here .  Your wyvern may be small , but he his powerful .  Nonetheless , you should learn to protect him .  Speak with Sain About proper lance tactics .   "   He said calmly .  Sain had a better lance technique than Kent . \
The ride south was punctuated by a brief stop at a traveling Merchant's Sloop .  Kai spent all of their recent earnings on Wyvern chow .  Namely , a Veritable herd of Antelius Sides , Salted , and magically frozen .  He gave a side to the Wyvern who happily ate , before he placed them on his two newest pack horses .  The rest of the journey was uneventful . \
That was , until they reached the Shrine .  They heard a loud scream from the shrine , and saw a Middle aged man , standing with watchful eyes .  Almost as if he was standing guard . \
Kai signaled the stop quietly , and directed the three warriors down south , to visit the homesteads near the shrine , To Discover what the matter was .  He Looked at Ariana with a slight nod of approval , and then knelt down , looking Garnet in the eyes .    "  Garnet\'85 Neither of you are ready for combat .  I want you both to fall back to the forts we just passed .  Take cover within one .   "   He said quietly .  The Wyvern nodded , but waited on Ariana's Approval .    "  Ariana , Take good care of your Friend .  Garnet , protect Ariana .  Go on .   "  \
Kai sighed as they trotted away .  Then he looked at the homesteads .  The three had arrived and were now talking with the men and women inside .  He nodded solemnly , and walked to the man standing guard .  When he heard the man grunt , he looked at him .    "  Is something the matter ?  "  \
  "  You need to leave .  Now .  Go someplace else .  Shrine is closed for cleaning .   "  \
  "  I doubt they would have to close a shrine this big , just to clean it .   "  \
  "  You leave now , and I won't kill you .   "  \
Kai looked shocked .  Then he realized .  The man was one of the brigands .  He looked on in fear as the man slammed him with an axe , sending him barreling into a wall .  The wall cracked slightly , and Kai coughed .  A Splatter of blood lay on the ground . \
Lyn was the first to see it .    "  KENT ! SAIN ! QUICKLY ! They're trying to kill Kai !  "  \
Kent and Sain nodded , charging towards the entrance while Lyn ran like the fires of hell fueled her soul .    "  YOU ROTTEN BASTARD !  "  \
She screamed her lungs out as the two knights went directly for Kai , dismounting and checking the boy .  Kai looked dazed , and weak , but he seemed just as strong as any other day .  They quickly escorted him to one of the forts , as Lyn reached her target . \
Lyn screamed bloody murder as she swung her blade as hard as she could .  A Loud chink was heard as the head of the brigand's axe went flying .  Her own sword bent harshly , but she continued to attack , in a wild fury , trying to slay the beast in front of her . \
The Brigand Shifted over , and dodged her first strike , but the second went true , slicing into his arm , and eliciting a scream of pain , Pulling two more off of the shrines Natural Hills . \
She shut her mouth quickly , and lunged , her bent blade piercing through the brigand's stomach , and she ripped to the side , the now slightly dinged up blade nearly ripping the man in half . \
She turned , and swung wildly at the brigand slipping up behind her , even as he simply grabbed her wrists , and flung her against the wall . \
Kent had seen , and was running for her as fast as he could ; While Sain and Ariana cared for the injured Kai .  Kai coughed harshly every time they touched his back .    "  I think\'85 they broke my ribs\'85  "   He uttered , knowing full and well they had also punctured his lung , due to a stone sticking just a little to far out . \
Lyn was in pain .  Her hand groped around through the tears in her eyes , trying to find her sword .  She frowned as she felt something stick her hand .  Wiping the tears slowly , she looked , and pulled the shard of metal free .    "  Oh no\'85  "   She said .  Her sword had shattered .  It was then she saw the twin axmen behind her .    "  No\'85 no no ! NO !  "  \
She lashed out , trying to kick them , but they simply batted her back into the ground .  She struggled up against the wall , standing up .  Their yellow tinged clothing made her realize something .  These were Taliver Bandits .  And they wanted her blood . \
Kent burst through the trees , even as the first bandit began to swing .  His axe collided with stone above Lyn's head , causing the crack in the wall to widen .  Lyn was huddled down , looking for a way out .  Then it happened . \
A slowly drizzle of blood hit her feet , followed by a veritable geyser .  Kent had rammed his lance through the neck of the bandit , and was still riding , slowly yanking the wound open , until the man's bones yanked it free of his hands , and broke it .  Kent cursed as his horse bucked , dodging an axe blow .  Lyn lay there , pushing the bandit's falling corpse away , covered in the red , iron smelling liquid .  She rolled out of the area where the battle was occurring , and backed up . \
Sain Burst through the bushes , and snatched her up , putting her in front of him on his horse .  He quickly turned , riding hard back towards the forts .  Though , even at a time like this , he couldn't resist the urge .  He scooted his hips a little closer to Lyn's , who , although stunned by the gore that had showered her , had the sense to elbow him hard in the ribs .  The now Windless Sain scooted back a bit , and tried to breath .    "  And that's just the beginning , Bastard !  "   She yelled above the horse's gallop . \
Kent Stared at the brigand in front of him , his sword at the ready , and his horse circling . \
  "  You know , Knight , My friend was really a new recruit !  "  \
  "  Then do not put Journeymen in a battle !  "   He said vehemently and jumped his horse forward , landing side on to the bandit , and lunging with the sword .  He missed cleanly , but the bandit had his axe aimed at the knight's Leg .  The leg armor was barely dented , but the bruise welled up nicely inside the armor , and his horse whinnied . \
  "  Kun , Chi !  "   He said , His Vaguely Ilian words causing the horse to plant one of its bladed hoofs in the bandit's foot as it jumped clear of the closeness . \
He turned his horse and looked at the bandit who was screaming in utter pain .  He wore no shoes , so the damage was apparent .  His left foot was completely crushed , and there were no longer toes . \
Kent backed his horse two steps before ordering it to charge , and plunging the blade deep into the bandit's chest , holding tightly as his horse charged on through , causing the blade to slam against his foe's ribs , before he had to pull it free .  Even then , the blade suffered the damage of ripping through the Brigand's collar bone .  Three sets of eyes looked up in cold silence around the knight .  He sighed , and galloped back towards the fort .  He could hear arguing inside the shrine . \
The injured Tactician Slowly rose , and stood between Lyn and Sain , who were arguing vehemently .    "  I SAID BE QUIET !  "   He yelled , and then went into a coughing fit , drawing Ariana to his side .    "  Kai , Be still , your ribs are broken\'85  "  \
  "  I am still\'85 the commander of this Army , by Lady Lyn's leave\'85 I will not tolerate this infighting .   "   He gasped slowly before throwing up a wave of blood that had trickled into his stomach .  He growled lowly .    "  Now\'85 Ariana , treat me if you will .  Lyn , Go begin lashing horses to tear down the weak section of wall .  There is a fallen tree close by .  Tie two horses to it , and hang it between them .  Use it like a battering ram .  Bust down the wall .   "  \
Lyn nodded .  Shoddy , but effective .  She stalked outside , growling at Sain harshly .  Kent nodded to her as he dismounted and rushed inside . \
  "  Master Kai , I have found that there are at least two more brigands inside the shrine .   "  \
Kai nodded slowly   "  So , I see\'85 What happened to your leg\'85 ?  "  \
  "  A brigand hammered me in the leg .  It's just a bruise .   "  \
Kai growled .    "  It's not JUST a bruise , it's a wound .  An Exploitable weakness .  Help Lyn with the Ram .  Sain , I want you to walk around the front of the Shrine , and enter .  Be wary of an ambush .   "  \
Sain nodded , and mounted his horse , galloping off towards the small hills inside the short road to the front of the shrine . \
Kai laid back on the softer bed , screwing up his face in pain .    "  Let me rest , Ariana .  My back feels as if it's been torn open .   "   Ariana nodded calmly , and sat down on her wyvern , who looked a bit concerned . \
Kent and Lyn had assembled the ram , and rode their horses hard , charging towards the building .  They suddenly pulled their mounts up short , flinging the wooden payload at the wall , nearly busting it down .    "  RELOAD !  "   Lyn cried , and marched her horse towards the log , as Kent followed suit . \
Sain walked his horse into the shrine .  He looked around suspiciously .  There weren't any brigands in sight , but he could see a man with a large sword sitting tall on the throne , a smug expression on his face .  He pulled his spear to the ready , and charged .    "  AHHHHHH !  "   He screamed loudly , his spear coming up for a harsh stabbing strike . \
He didn't expect it when the Brigand leapt out of the shadows , grabbing his spear , and pulling him off the horse .  Sain fell back heavily , drawing his sword calmly , and facing off against the brigand .  The brigand leapt up to attack the slightly winded knight , and Sain simply rolled under his foe , and turned , his sword lashing through the man's hips in a quick flash . \
The brigand landed quietly , and then fell apart with a sickening thud and a plop , blood pooling around him like a newborn river in the spring . \
Kent cursed as the wall fell in , as he saw Sain lying there , panting . \
  "  SAIN !  "     "  Kent ! My friend ! No worries , I just need to catch my breath .  My horse ran off after this brigand unseated me , and I cannot find my spear .   "  \
Kent nodded , dismounting next to Sain .    "  You look winded .  Perhaps you should get some fresh air .  These candles do you no good .   "   Sain nodded . \
Lyn stood in front of them .    "  Well , Sain ?  "   Sain stood slowly , faking a trip into Lyn's bosom .  He soon found her fist in his face , and a nice black welt sealing his left eye shut .  He walked towards the fort , a defeated look on his face . \
Kent mounted on his horse once more , drawing his blade to the ready , and charging it towards the man on the throne .  The man's quiet cackling sounded quietly .    "  Mani Katti will not be mine ? Then I will show it who is worthy ! I don't need the sacred sword\'85  "   he said , looking right at Kent as he leapt into the air ,   "  TO DESTROY YOU !  "  \
His guttural voice was loud and shocking to Kent's Horse as it reared back in fright , as the butt of the Mercenary's sword slammed him into the ground . \
Kent struggled up quickly , his blade at the ready .  His foe smirked , and leapt again , his heavier sword slamming into Kent's slightly damaged iron one .  The parry stopped the blow , but did nothing for Kent's Ego as he saw his blade crack . \
The man named glass swung again .  The sidelong slash busted through Kent's Last hope , slamming him aside .  He grunted as he felt a rib crack . \
Glass grinned manically .    "  The old man can run , but the sword cannot ! Where is it ? Where is Mani Katti ?  "  \
Lyn dashed to Kent as Glass's Back was turned .  She dragged him to his feet , and they ran outside , collapsing next to Sain . \
My eyes flew open .  I was looking at it all wrong\'85 Ever since the battle with Zugu , I had become more and more detached from myself .  That was why we were loosing .    "  That's it !  "   I said .  And I started meditating .  Gloriously , the pain ceased . \
I felt myself shifting to Lyn .    "  Lyn ! Are you okay ?  "  \
  "  Yes\'85 I'm fine Kai .  Glad to see you're back with us .   "  \
Kent nodded and smiled .    "  A little Wounded , but no worse for the wear .   "  \
Sain nodded .    "  A Big seething Hole in my ego , but I'm fine .   "  \
I nodded to them .    "  Good .  I'll be right back .   "  \
I shifted my presence to Ariana , but found myself instead looking at a Wyvern . \
The wyvern simply smiled , and I felt a voice inside my head .    "  Well well , it seems like you ARE a tactician after all !  "  \
I looked at him strangely .    "  You're kidding me\'85 Wyverns are Telepathic ?  "  \
Garnet just looked at his claws calmly .    "  Yes\'85 We are .  How do you think we're so much better than Pegasus at battle ?  "  \
I was stunned .  Articulate to a fault , and nonchalant\'85 No wonder Wyverns were battle mounts .    "  Oh fine .  It doesn't matter .  Come on .  I need you to get Ariana .   "  \
  "  She charged off towards the shrine .   "  \
  "  WHAT ! Without my orders ! Is she INSANE ?  "  \
  "  No , she's brave , and she has a Wyvern .   "  \
I looked at him strangely .  He smiled , and got up , before taking off with a burst of speed I had not seen any beast give .    "  Fine .  I'll help her out .   "   He said , and stopped in front of her , motioning to his back .  Ariana smiled gleefully , and nodded . \
She mounted him like a true Knight would mount a wyvern .    "  So , she's had training ?  "  \
  "  No , she's had me to teach her how to fight from wyvern back .   "  \
I nodded slowly .  They were a blur as they passed by Lyn .    "  There he is .  There's Glass\'85 I recognize him .  He was wanted for three murders in Bulgar .  They think he's got a connection to the Taliver !  "  \
Garnet Nodded , and slammed into Glass .  Though a mere child , by wyvern Standards , He was heavy enough to bowl a man over very well . \
Ariana Simply jammed her spear into Glass's Lungs as he turned .  The Mercenary screamed loudly , breaking the spear off . \
  "  DAMN  "   I shouted .  There went our last spear , and this man was well trained with a sword . \
Garnet smiled .    "  No worries .   "   And inhaled .  A Searing wave of dry heat shot forth , causing wood near Glass to catch , rather quickly .  Glass stopped dead in his tracks , holding his blade before his face , watching the metal glow red .  Better to have a busted sword than a pair of busted eyes he thought . \
That's when he realized his shirt was catching fire , heating the already hot chain mail beneath his tunic up even more .  The Metal began to melt , catching glass's flesh on fire . \
Glass screamed harshly , his body being incinerated , as Garnet stood there , watching the pyre .  Ariana giggled with glee .    "  GOOD JOB GARNET !  "   She cackled quietly .  The man's screaming was permeated by gasps of air and sobs .  Kai watched in utter fascination . \
Ariana dismounted , and began to dance around the burning man , whose sword began to melt back down onto his body , the iron unable to take the heat .    "  Fire Fire , Burning higher , making music like a choir !  "  \
She chanted this as she danced around the man , until his screaming stopped .  She giggled , and continued to dance .  Kai looked at Garnet , who shrugged .    "  Her Parents Died in a harsh winter , from the cold .  I saw her shivering there , and I comforted her .  When she discovered I could breathe fire , the only thing that fought away the cold better than my body , she never left my side .  She Loves fire .   "  \
Kai nodded quietly .  Bernian winters were hard and cold .  Worse almost than Ilian . \
The soldiers had spent the afternoon dragging corpses out of the cathedral , and Garnet spent it barbequing them with his arid breath .  He feasted while Ariana played with fire .  Kai rolled his eyes at them .  A damned Dragon and a young lady who loved to burn things . \
Kent and Sain were repairing their armor at a small farmer's market just to the south of the shrine .  They were also purchasing new equipment for the group .  Kent was holding Sain away from the owner's daughter , under pain of a pike , where the sun doesn't shine .  Sain , for once , held himself in check . \
Lyn was trying to open the door to the Priest's Sanctum , and sat heavily on the throne , sighing . \
The door creaked open , and a Bishop walked out .  He smiled .    "  So , you are the one who defeated the Man , Glass , are you ?  "  \
  "  No , but I am the leader of the Troops who did .   "   I said , walking towards him slowly , blotting the blood from my lips .  My entire body hurt , and I was nearly delirious .  Seeing me nearly collapse onto a pew was enough for the bishop , who immediately grabbed a staff . \
  "  By the Goddess , Child , what happened !  "   He said excitedly , and stood beside me , chanting slowly .    "  Powers of Life , I call unto thee , Please , Heal this boy of his wounds .  Make him well , Mend his body !  "   He said as a large glowing sphere that engulfed even his body erupted from the staff he held .    "  Take his pain !  "   And he slammed the staff down . \
Suddenly , I was illuminated by the light , and I could feel my body mending .  The holy staff's orb slowly cracked as it took my body's pain , but the process was complete before it was anywhere near broken , or spent . \
I smiled as Kent and Sain received the treatment , Followed by Ariana and her mount , and then Lyn .  The entire troop was healed , and we all relaxed .  We hadn't felt this good since we had all just met in Bulgar . \
That was when the Hand maiden of the shrine brought forth the Mani Katti .  The bishop smiled .    "  For your Bravery , and Honor , Lady Lyn , I will allow you to touch this sacred blade .   "  \
Lyn grinned with glee .    "  I had only hoped to pray before it , but perhaps this will work much better .   "  \
She laid her hands on the markings along the sheathe , and began to pray . \
Suddenly , I felt a pulse of energy from my heaven seal .    "  WHA ?  "   I shouted , staring at the glow of my seal . \
Suddenly , Lyn's eyes flew open , and the sheathe began to emanate a strong blue glow in her hands .    "  What is this !  "   She said anxiously . \
The bishop stared in awe .    "  The blade ! It has accepted you , Lady Lyn , as its master .   "   He held onto his staff for support , the old man looking quite\'85 strange .  He was grinning much too wide for his old face .    "  Quickly , draw the blade !  "  \
She obeyed without question , pulling the blade from it's sheathe .  She expected it to come out with a slow jerky motion .  It came out with a glide so smooth , I could have sworn only magic could have done it .  She stared at the blade\'85   "  It came out effortlessly !  "  \
I smiled at her .    "  Such a Lovely thing .  It seems as if the blade could see your soul , and knew how much you needed its assistance .   "   I smiled .    "  May we take the blade with us , Lord Bishop ?  "  \
I didn't know the man's name , so he just used the honorific for him .  The bishop slowly nodded .    "  The shrine will take years to repair and resanctify .  The blood spilt here would slowly corrupt the blade .  So , I think , while the Shrine is in this state , I think it would be best to use the blade for its intended use .  To protect those who cannot fight for themselves .   "  \
He obviously meant she should protect me , but I didn't mind .  She had a sacred blade .  We all turned , and bid them both farewell , as we walked out , and turned southwest , towards the Caelin Canton .  We were homeward bound . \
Along the path , Lyn finally admitted her fears .    "  It's not right\'85 something's wrong\'85 how can a blade choose me ?  "  \
I sighed .  Sain spoke up .    "  Lady Lyn , you see , you're looking too much into the matter .  Think of it like this .  Some weapons feel more comfortable in your hands , correct ? Well , the Mani Katti Itself feels VERY comfortable in your hand .   "  \
She nodded .    "  That , I think , I can accept .  This is\'85 My responsibility .  This is my sword .   "   She said with pride . \
We both smiled , and Kent smirked .    "  And it was just waiting for you to draw it .   "  \
She looked unnerved .    "  Don't say that ! I'm nothing special ! I'm just an ordinary Lady .   "  \
We walked on , continuing our path , all smiling and content .  The battles were forgotten , and we were all friends .  I noticed Kent drop back to whisper something to Lyn .  I smiled .  Those two made a cute looking couple , and I knew Kent would give his life for Lady Lyn in a heartbeat . \
Sain decided to speak up .    "  Lady Lyn , you do know that you are the granddaughter of Marques Caelin , No ?  "  \
She shook her head .    "  I didn't\'85 .   "   She looked kind of spooked .  Kent spoke next .    "  We are journeying with you , to escort you to Caelin , so you can take your Rightful place\'85 .  But Lord Lundgren , your Uncle , and the Masques' Brother , wants the throne at any cost .  He will not hesitate to kill you .   "  \
Lyn nodded , and Gulped .    "  My grandfather\'85 .  The only Family I have left\'85 I must see him .  I Must .   "   She said this with a Certainty I had not seen in her save for when she fought against Batta .    "  Then we are Caelin bound .  We will cross the mountain range , and head for Lycia through Bern's upper corner . \
They were only a day away from the village , before Kai felt another pulse of his Heaven seal\'85 Something was happening up ahead\'85 something that could Decide Lyn's Fate . \
-Ba-bump-\
The pulse of the seal\'85 .  It was TELLING me something .  It had to be .  But what ? I was\'85 worried .  My ribs still had an ache , and I was feeling like something akin to hell it's self was coming for us .  It was time to wage war\'85 but on whom , and when ?\
We arrived at the small community of villages on the border of Bern .  We were almost out of the village when I felt a pulse so strong , I faltered off my horse .    "  STOP THE MOVEMENT !  "   I yelled as though it were my final wish . \
Everyone stopped short , even as Garnet invaded my mind slightly .  His hiss let me know he knew .  'I felt something odd as well . ' I thought to myself calmly .  Then I realized it was garnet .  That would be unnerving , I knew .  Is this how I sounded to all of them ?\
I pushed my thoughts aside .    "  Something\'85 comes .   "   I heard the beat of wings as a Pegasus flew down . \
Unfortunately , I had the grace , tact , and good fortune , to receive the front hoof of a flying horse in my face .  After I recovered from the slightly painful blow , wiping away the blood from my busted nose , the tears from my eyes , and unfreezing a small amount of antellius hide to help the swelling in my eyes , I looked at the girl who was riding on the beast's back . \
  "  Damn right something comes , now , what in the nine hells are you doing near my Lyndis !  "  \
Though slight , trim , fit , and undoubtedly beautiful , this girl was a minx .  Sain , in his unfathomable wisdom , was staring at her with eyes that would bore through to the soul of the general with the thickest armor in the world .  A mix of lust , and anger , I would say .  Dangerous eyes . \
Kent was eager to help me up , and give the woman a wide berth . \
Ariana was also there , helping me up , rubbing a vulnerary on my face .  I could vaguely think of laughing , even as I knew it was garnet , who was rejoicing in this very small victory for his ego . \
Lyn was busy staring dumbly at Florina .  She was blushing for some reason . \
I suddenly felt Ariana stop rubbing my eyes .  I wiped some vulnerary away , and was struck dumb and deaf .  Florina was literally kissing Lyn .  And Lyn WASN'T giving her an eye so black it would be invisible in the night . \
For a total of three minutes we stood there .  Even the bandits I could barely recognize coming up on our left were struck dumb . \
  "  HOLD IT !  "  \
My yelled distracted everyone from the blatantly public display of affection .    "  Bandits , please go back around the wall .  We'll come out and fight or whatever in a moment .   "   The leader nodded dumbly before he pushed all of his followers around the wall .  Kent tapped Lyn and caught a fist in the face from the woman in white and blue . \
Sain leapt towards her , and dragged the two apart , receiving very many blows from the Pegasus woman in the process . \
  "  Alright , thank you Sain .  Hold her down .   "   I looked at garnet .    "  Excuse me , Garnet , do you have any idea in the nine hells what just happened .   "  \
'Well it's obvious , if you're telepathic .  Lyn is of the persuasion that that is a simple Ilian custom .  Whereas Florina , as her mind calls her body , is simply a dyke . '\
  "  Err\'85 a dyke ?  "  \
'Of the persuasion to seek a female for a mate , despite being female . '\
I sighed .  Great .  A girl's girl .    "  Lyn\'85 That's NOT an Ilian custom .  That's an Excuse Florina uses to suck your face off .   "  \
Lyn looked at me strangely .    "  How did you\'85  "  \
  "  Let's just say that this is no Ordinary Wyvern .  Leave it at that .   "  \
Suddenly , a green Blur flew by me , slamming into a red armored man , they both ended up in a strangely yellow roll of pain . \
  "  OH GOD ! A Man touched me ! EW ! Oh god , Lyn ! They'll hurt me ! He touched me !  "  \
Lyn's eyes caught a blaze , and I looked at garnet .  He shook his head no .    "  Not that kind of touch Lyn .   "  \
  "  He was on top of Florina ! How could he resist such an opportunity ?  "  \
Sain stood up , and calmly walked toward Florina .  And then he did something no one expected .  He punched her square between the eyes .    "  Ilian Wretch ! Harm my commander , or my friend once more , and I will personally cleave the wings from your Mount !  "  \
I looked at Lyn .    "  He's only a maritime Pervert .   "   Her nod signified she understood . \
Florina Looked at Sain .    "  Y-y-y-you Hit me !  "  \
  "  Yes , I did .  And you deserved it .  You were acting like a Damned heathen with no education ! If you are from Ilia , then act like it ! I swear , if my mom had acted half as bad as you , I would have hit her too ! Show some Decency !  "   Decidedly the perverted fool of a Big Brother to this army . \
Kent was the learned Sage of a middle brother .  Lyn was the average meek but fiery middle sister , Ariana and I , the Outside loners .  I sighed .    "  Alright , that's it .   "  \
  "  BANDITS ! Come on back !  "   I shouted . \
The leader stepped around the wall , pointing at himself .  God , bandits were so ignorant at times .    "  Yes , yes , You , Come on .  What in the nine hells is going on here\'85  "  \
He pointed at Florina .    "  She had her bitch of a horse land on me !  "  \
Florina pointed her finger at her horse .    "  Do you know how hard it is to land one of these things !  "  \
I sighed .    "  Florina , did you apologize to him ?  "  \
  "  HELL NO !  "   they shouted at the same time . \
  "  Alright , that's it .  We fight for it .  The stakes ? Florina and her mount .  Winner takes all .   "  \
Sain grabbed her as she began to charge at me , holding her tightly by the arm , blocking her punches with one hand , looking bored .    "  Fine , I was going to suggest the same thing .   "  \
  "  Then shut up and get ready to fight .   "  \
As he went around the wall , I sighed .    "  On your training mission , Florina ?  "  \
She nodded .    "  Then you're a part of Lyndis' legion now .   "  \
I smiled at her .    "  Alright , Knights , Take the front .  Wait in ambush around the pinch point we passed earlier .   "  \
Kent and Sain Nodded , hopping onto their mounts .  Unfortunately , the only weapons they had were the two swords they had retained from the last battle . \
  "  Ariana !  "  \
The young Wyvern rider stood at attention .    "  I want you scouting .  Take to the skies .  Garnet , Inform me of everything you see .  I want to know if the Bandit leader has a maggot on his ass , if you can see it .  Only assist if you have to .  Garnet is still our Trump Card .  Are we clear , Ariana ?  "  \
  "  SIR !  "   She yelled as she grabbed up her lance and hopped aboard her wyvern .  I would have put her in combat , but she had no armor . \
Lyndis looked at the nearest village and jerked her thumb towards it .  I nodded my approval , and smacked the Pegasus rider on the back .    "  Florina .  Take to the skies , but fly low .  They might have Archers .  Head to the Northern village .  Report anything you find .  Do not ransack the homes , but warn them .  We don't need civilian Casualties .   "  \
Florina Snorted .    "  I'll never take orders from a MAN !  "  \
I looked over at her , and jerked her down to my face , snarling .    "  Then take orders from a Demon .  Because if you don't get that sissy ass horsefly of this ground right now , I'm going to cut you into tomorrow night's meal with my Katar , capeesh ?  "  \
  "  Capeesh !  "   She shouted , and flew off .  I smiled .  Then I began to climb up a tree .  Best way to see battle , was of course , from the treetops .  I didn't bother shifting .  I just reached out to garnet , smiling . \
  "  Alright , what have we here , wyvern ?  "  \
'Looks like the Maggots on the Bandit leader are all dead . '\
  "  Well , that's one less worry .  Let's see\'85 examine the pinch point .   "  \
Ariana nodded in unison with garnet , and they flew off , looking towards the ground .  'CHIEF !' garnet mind-hollered . \
I switched astrally , even as I felt a new presence join the battle .  I sat atop the wyvern , staring down .  Kent and Sain had dismounted , their swords drawn as they waited on the first axe wielding murderer to charge into the small clearing near the bushes .  But that wasn't my worry .  An archer behind the wall was drawing a bead on Sain .    "  Got to run Garnet , Do me a favor , and drop a fresh load on one of those bandits .   "  \
I jumped down out of the tree , running towards Sain .  There wasn't a way in hell he could dodge that arrow .  He was in a very bad position , and that archer was using a damn good bow , even if it was very worn .  It looked like it was on its last strings . \
  "  SAIN !  "   I yelled , already working my hands in the pattern for one of my blessings .    "  CHAINS !  "   I yelled , even as the arrow whistled through the air .  The ethereal chains draped over the arrow , and a wall of them formed in front of the arrow .  Its silver tipped head slammed head on into them , and I grunted , feeling my fingers bleed as the held the position\'85 Just a few seconds more and I could release the Position , but if I held it to long , that arrow would pierce right through my hand .    "  GET READY !  "  \
Sain braced for impact as I let my hand loose the arrow .  The silver tip slammed hard into Sain's shoulder armor , and he grunted , the dent in the armor barely cracking .  A thin trickle of blood began to ooze out .  He nodded his thanks , and leapt on the charging brigand , his blade aloft .    "  KENT ! CROSS !  "   He shouted .  His blade slipped across the bandit's Knee pits , the soft supple flesh giving way as the blade bit into the tendons and ligaments behind . \
Kent smirked .    "  SLASH !  "   he yelled , and ran out of the bushes , his left handed swordsman ship was on par with that of a sword master's right hand .  It sliced cleanly through the bandit's neck , but didn't decapitate him ; instead , a soft blue light seemed to emanate from the man's throat .    "  SHIT ! They have a Tactician !  "   Kent yelled , as he turned and plunged his blade through the brigand's chest , slaying him with the final blow .  I doubt even a walling blessing would have held him back . \
They both fell back to the bushes , and nodded in unison .    "  Mount up !  "   I said telepathically , as the tense situation averted .  I wouldn't have to worry about silver arrows for a moment , so I could go back to focusing on my Battle's wholeness . \
Florina smiled as she carried the small red orb with her , flying towards me .    "  Back to battle , girl .  I want you to ambush any sword wielders you find .  But DO NOT get within the space of an arrow's flight to one of those archers .   "   She nodded quietly . \
Lyn tapped the tree I was perched on .  We had reached a stalemate .  Their two archers were waiting patiently for Kent or Sain to move .  But thanks to a slight cloaking spell , they were hidden within the bushes .  Only a movement as extravagant of say , three inches would alert them .  Florina was trying to locate a safe path into the protective range of the archers , to take out one of the sword wielders .  Garnet was trying to decide who to unload his steadily increasing payload of putrid ness .  I looked down at Lyn , as I climbed the tree again , and said   "  Yes , Milady ?  "  \
  "  I found someone you might want to meet .   "   She pointed at an archer .    "  Names Will , Mister Strategist .   "   I nodded at him .    "  Good .  We need someone of your talents .  See that line of trees ? The one illuminated in blue ?  "   He nodded , though he looked decidedly freaked out . \
  "  I see em .  Who needs a new feather headdress ?  "  \
I smiled .    "  Climb the tree I've illuminated in yellow .  When you reach the top , you should be able to spy an archer , illuminated in red .  I was you to give him a nice , feathery eye patch .   "  \
He nodded , and ran off , smiling .  I could feel that this man loved to shoot his bow .  He really didn't care what the target was .  Lyn smiled .    "  Lyn , Take the Mani Katti .  You know the Pinch point Correct ?  "  \
She nodded quietly : I grabbed an apple from the branch I was sitting on .    "  When you run , I want you to throw your remaining iron sword at the lead bandit .  Try to hit him in the chest .  Let the two knights pass you .  They are to slash him together , and rush towards that building down south .  Florina is to fly that direction as well .  You are to wait in the blind spot of that wall .  Then , you will charge , as they pass .  The ARCHER is the first target .  None of this happens without Wil's arrow making the first blow .  Go !  "  \
They assumed position , as my voice echoed in each of their heads .  My eyes became Garnet's and we watched the battle .  I saw one of the archers tense his bowstring .    "  Release the blessing , garnet , right on that one's head .   "  \
Wil pulled the string back on his bow and sighted down the arrow quietly\'85 a swift sharp twang and a screech as the archer fell , clawing at the arrow that went through his eye , and cleanly out the back of his head , barely missing his brain and Spinal column .  He seemed to seize .  I recognized the magicks .  'Mercy . ' I thought simply .  A spell a strategist worth his salt never hoped to use .  It ripped a soul from a dying body with such force ; the soul would never feel pain again , even if they dove into the pits of hell . \
Garnet snarled as he relaxed .  I vaguely watched the blackish gift fall to the earth . \
-SPLAT !- The heavenly gift showed just how much Favor the archer had with the gods .  It was only then that the charge started .  Then the ambushing began . \
Savior , another gift , usable only by the most fortuitous , which my heaven seal seemed to be charged with , was readied .  I could feel the pulse .  He knew the ambush was coming . \
I shifted to Kent .    "  Make sure your strike is fatal .  Both of you .   "   I looked across the way at Sain .  The quiet nod was shared , and they went out .  A swift slice , meant to disembowel his foe , brought the brigand to his knees , curtsey of Kent's blade . \
The spell took effect , the guts of the man slowing , before finally going within his stomach again .  The cut sealed it's self with a faint red glow .  But the first Savior would be that man's last .  Sain's blade was through the man's head and out the other side before he could have even realized he had just died once . \
I heard the tactician yell .    "  DAMN YOU ! You are no tactician , you are a demon !  "   of course , the mental yell was enough to shake me up .  I shuddered , and sent Kent and Sain on their way , towards what looked to be an Armory .  Wil was busy feathering another of his admirers .  Lyn saw her prey , the now feces covered archer sulking by . \
  "  KYAH !  "   She was cut short on her swing by a Pegasus knight , diving in , and crushing the archer beneath her mount .  That was when the shit hit the fan . \
Suddenly , axes flashed , and I was forced to intervene .  My opponent had seen the Pegasus knight telegraph her move .  I would have been happy to let her perish .  But the axes had been aimed at Lyn .  Self preservation and the preservation of purpose were the reasons I did what I did . \
  "  SHIELD !  "   I yelled physically , and my arms were suddenly cut to ribbons as I held them steady .  The magical shielding I had placed over my charge and her ally took the blows force , reduced it , and fed it into my body .  And the hands , one of a strategist's most important things , were always the first to go .  We sacrificed ourselves for our army .  That was how it was , but I would keep this shield up until I had distributed orders , despite the blood flowing from my arms . \
  "  Full on attack .  No prisoners .  Garnet , stay in the air .  Spill no blood in this engagement .  Lyn , take down the first you can and flee to the armory .  Sain , Kent .  Both of you guard Lyn .  When she reaches you , charge them .  Lyn , accompany the charge , but do not put yourself in unnecessary danger .   "   I nearly screamed at this point as I felt something like an axe bite into my side as more of my power drained into the spell .  I had to be quick .    "  Florina ! GET THE HELL OFF OF MY BATTLE FIELD YOU IRRESPONSIBLE WENCH !  "   My arm nearly snapped as I heard them agree .  Florina snorted .  I snarled , and dropped the shield , when it was clear . \
As woozy as I was , and as drained , I could still see the battle , and hear the other strategist's mocking laughter .    "  Holding a shield spell that long would have done in one of BERN'S tacticians .  Your army will die , and your powers will be mine , bitch .  I know you carry a blood bind !  "  \
I smirked .  The battle broke like a wave on the shore .  Lyn had dashed next to a brigand , and jammed her sacred blade in his stomach .  The Mani-Katti almost seemed to sing as its crimson coated tip erupted from his side , looking like it had simply sliced butter .  Migal's jaw dropped as he watched from behind the barrier of the recently burned village on the hillside .  He looked over at the black cloaked man .    "  Ner-  "  \
The black-cloak silenced him with a glance .    "  The talons of what you fear will dig deep , Taliver dog , if you do not keep silent .  This battle is life or death for that other commander .  And a cornered dog will fight till his dying breath .  I've cut off his front paws , but I need your Brigands to cut his back two .   "   He smiled .  Father would be most proud . \
The gold eye scared Migal .  He was here to find women and money , not a war with mercenaries .  But the strange one insisted .  He gulped . \
  "  That man who spoke to the boss never said anything about getting into this mess ! I'm losing men down there !  "   Migal stood up , about to brandish his axe .  And then he found himself siding , with a pain in his groin , and a swell from behind his nose .  He felt that strange sensation , like he was being watched .    "  I said keep silent !  "   the voice was a hiss as he looked into the black-cloak's ethereal face .    "  YOU will join your men in the killing fields then !  "   the amulet about his neck snapped loudly .    "  And your men have lost my guidance now !  "  \
Kent and Sain jumped their horses into the fray behind a steadily retreating Lyn , who turned as they jumped over her .  Their horses panted as the plowed through the first rank of men . \
But this was too easy .  They had a strategist .  There should have been some kind of a move that stonewalled the foolhardy rush .  The men weren't even being saved by spells .  Nor were they putting up a decent fight anymore .  Kent looked at Sain .    "  This has become to easy\'85  "  \
Lyn snorted as she looked at the brigand in front of her .  A boy , perhaps 17 years of age , held a shaky axe .    "  You're telling me\'85 they aren't even learned at how to use an axe .   "  \
The boy's following view would have made anyone's day , if he had not been shitting himself at the moment she lifted her leg right into his face , sending him barreling back into his brother who held a sword .  They both gulped .    "  Run .   "   Was all Lyn said as she Purposely kicked the boy with the sword between the legs for gawking . \
Sain winced , and marched his horse OVER the two boys , horse hoofs stamping down beside their heads .    "  Be glad she shows you mercy .  Go home , and stay off the battle field !  "  \
Kent snarled as he walked over , dropping a rag soaked in blood and gore beside him .  The boys waited till the pair had passed , and then got up\'85 And ran like the hounds of hell were behind them . \
Bandits would come to know those two boys as the Cowards of Seville .  Then again , no one ever met Migal , a renowned axe man ever again\'85\
Lyn stood over the fallen body of Migal .  The man had been knocked off of a cliff , as far as she could tell .  He had been the leader of this gang of men .  His skull was busted clean open ; the whole alley between the burnt village and the sheer cliffs was covered in blood from his fall .  There was basically nothing left of his skull , but the pink and yellow armor showed who he was well enough . \
Wil sighed as he shouted again .    "  Hallo ! Are your allies not coming back ?  "   He looked up in the tree , before blinking his eye strangely as he suddenly gained a black space in his vision .  Opening it back up , it was an obscene mix of the real , and a color of blood red .  He felt something cold hit his face . \
He reached up , and paled .  Blood .  And it was cold , so it had to have been a long time since it was spilt , but not long enough for the liquid to congeal .  He screamed as loud as he could .    "  LYN ! COME QUICKLY !  "  \
Lyn heard the shout , even as she made to grab the small amulet that looked strangely like her own .  But she stopped as she looked at Kent , who simply jerked her onto his horse . \
Garnet swooped down , seeing the archer covered in some blood speckles .  He had not been wounded , or so he though .  Garnet sniffed quietly , while Ariana immediately ran to the pack horses , withdrawing medical supplies .  Kai had talked her through some of the basics . \
Garnet snorted , and nudged Ariana , shaking his head .  She tilted it to the side .    "  It's not him bleeding ? Then who is ?  "   she looked at the tree .    "  Master Kai climbed up\'85 oh gods !  "   She barely got the last words out as garnet was up the tree , his claws giving him traction as he jumped up it much like a cat . \
Ariana and Wil watched , before she bit her lip and walked to the base of the tree , waiting on her Wyvern .  Lyn and Kent arrived next , Lyn instantly hopping off the horse .    "  Thank you Kun .   "   She said to the mare quietly as she stepped beside Wil .    "  What's going on Wil ?  "  \
He shook his head .    "  I don't know .  But there was blood leaking out of a tree .  I called you because I couldn't remember which tree Kai had climbed up .   "   He shook his head sadly .    "  Then I was sniffed by a small Wyvern , and his lady , apparently .  She said something about this being the tree Kai was in , and , Zip , zoom , there went the wyvern , right up the tree .   "  \
Kent nodded sagely .    "  A Wyvern is hard to impress , but they will go to damn near any length to protect those they respect or love .   "   He stepped beside Lyn's other side and looked up as they heard growling . \
Sain rode up quickly , just as the fight broke out .  A Wyvern chased a Pegasus out of a tree , and he saw a woman fall from it , clutching a low branch tightly as her spear fell , right near Lyn .  The branch cracked , she screamed , and fell , squarely on her but .  He saw Kai fall a bit , then catch on the snag , his blood soaked sleeves pulling up with his cloak , showing off the razor thin cuts , with some that were entirely too deep . \
The boy fell to the ground quickly , collapsing in a heap .  He groaned softly , even as Sain dismounted .  Ariana was at his side , bright eyes dull as she began to wash the blood from his arms .  One of the same cuts ran along his side .  Sain knelt down beside her and helped , earning him an affectionate smile .    "  Thanks , mister Demon .   "   She said with a light tone . \
Sain looked at her with a smile .  A Running joke she seemed to be playing at .  She always called him mister demon .    "  Sure thing , Angel .   "   He said , earning a blush from her .  He looked at Florina who was jabbering something about 'Magic in the trees !'\
A moment before this . \
Florina had nearly shit herself when she was suddenly told to get off the battle field .  By a strategist no less .  That was a black mark like nothing else .  When you were told by an invalid of sorts to get off a battle field , it was being told you weren't even ready to begin to THINK of a Pegasus , which was a serious spit in the face . \
Florina had originally meant to go to the strategist and plead for her military career .  But he was passed out and bleeding , balanced over a branch .  She put her hand to his breast , and shook slightly .    "  Strategist ? Strategist !  "  \
Wil's shout was barely recognized as she franticly scoured her brain .    "  Oh god , what'll I do ?  "   She briefly registered that she had just willingly touched a man , which paled her cheeks , then turned them red with fury .  Still , she didn't hear anything but the gears in her mind until she heard a growl so loud it was\'85 scary ? Hot ? Humid ? Burning her Pegasus's fur ?\
She turned her head , to find herself looking into a ticket straight to hell .  A very pissed off wyvern had what looked to be curls of arid heat leaking out about a snarl .  Her Pegasus whinnied loudly , and bucked midair , sending her barreling ass-over-teakettle to the ground .  With a snap of the beast's wings , she saw the wyvern take off , flying after her mount , snapping the branch below the strategist's body with its tail as it flew its suicide course . \
Present time . \
Florina was weeping against the tree .  Wil and Kent were on her left and right , Lyn in the middle , crouched down and trying to decipher the girl's strangled voice . \
  "  EywashSobtrytoalkWeepwihestrgestCry !  "  \
  "  I was trying to talk with the Strategist .   "  \
  "  wnsobeyoterewheezeeasutup !  "  \
  "  When I got there , he was cut up !  "  \
WAIL !\
She nodded .  Lyn stood up , and looked at Kent and Wil .    "  Apparently , the wyvern scared her mount , who bucked her off , sent her tumbling down the tree , broke the limb , and is now trying stay out of a wyvern's stomach .   "  \
Wil cocked an eyebrow .    "  You got all that from a WAIL !  "   He scratched his head . \
She slammed her fist down onto his crown and growled .    "  No you idiot ! I got that from looking at the situation !  "  \
He raised his hand from his position on the ground .    "  Oh .   "   He said before laying his hand back down and groaning .  Damn she could hit . \
I groaned quietly .  He was so mad at that damn Pegasus and her rider .  Trying to hurt someone he respected .  I then realized that those weren't my thoughts .  It came into focus quickly as I struggled with the mind numbing pain . \
'DAMN BEAST OF BURDEN ! I WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES !'\
'Garnet , calm down\'85 I'm alive . '\
'Beast ! Where you learned to speak like me I'll\'85 oh wait , Kai !'\
'Yes , it's me Garnet .  Calm down and land .  I wasn't hurt by them . '\
'But\'85 the cuts on your arm ?'\
'Made by holding a spell in place . '\
'Oh . ' Garnet thought-said to me .  It was so blunt , average , and too the point , I was taken a bit aback as he landed quietly near Ariana . \
  "  Master Kai , you're Awake !  "   Sain looked at me with relief on his face .  Sain continued to wrap my arm in bandages quietly . \
Ariana smiled , and kissed me on the cheek , much to Sain's chagrin , I saw as I looked him in the eyes .  He just smiled at me and wrapped my arm some more .  I sighed .  Too much thinking to do when I hurt this badly .  My arms would be useless for a while , so nothing but advice from me for the army .  I groaned as they tied off the bandages and I sat up . \
The Villagers who had Befriended Wil insisted that the savior of their village be treated to a magnificent feast .  Huge legs of Mutton , massive amounts of porridge ( which was spiced generously , and delicious .  ) and huge orders of fruit . \
Wil was the first to belch from all the raspberry burdock he had just guzzled down .  With a load groan he leaned back , spying the woman across from him , who was quite attractive .  She grinned , and so did he .    "  Excuse me\'85  "   he said . \
I looked at him .    "  About time you showed some manners .   "   I muttered , and then realized he was getting up .    "  Leaving so soon ?  "  \
  "  Food , shelter , water , all these are filled , but the elusive fourth\'85  "   he said quietly as he walked away , and I sighed .    "  Great .   "  \
Lyn was the next , and while she was sitting beside me , her burp rocked me to my bones .  I looked over at her as she patted her belly pudge .    "  I'm so stuffed I feel like a hog !  "   She burped again , and sighed out an apology .    "  Oops .  Forgot my manners , but that was some good food !  "  \
Kent smiled .    "  Shall we retire , milady ?  "   She nodded at him gratefully .  I could tell she was into him , and he was falling in love .  It was as plain as the day , and making my stomach wrench in utter dejection .  Kent bowed , and gave his thanks to the village hetman . \
I looked over at Ariana Angel , as we had given her last name , since she had none she knew of .  She had changed into a different pair of clothes for the feast .  An elegant pure white cloak over a baby blue mage's tunic , with a flowing blue skirt that was only just deeper in color than her shirt .  A white beret adorned her head , and her almost violet eyes were setting the whole set off like a Bernian war-charge .  Her hair , I noticed , was the strangest thing I had seen .  It was as black as the night , but I could see violet streaking it so well , it had to have been natural . \
I sighed , noticing Sain .  The man liked green , that was sure .  Even his leisure clothes were green .  He smiled as they got up and left the table , leaving me with the village minus one .  I grumbled as I fumbled with the fork again .  My hands were shot .  I shook my head .  I hadn't even finished my first plate , and I was a very accomplished eater . \
The hetwoman frowned , and sat beside me , helping me eat .  I was truly an invalid as I looked over at Florina who was frowning desperately .  I looked at the hetwoman .    "  You don't have to do this\'85  "  \
  "  Nonsense\'85 my son was a Tactician , just like you .   "   I frowned .  I wasn't a tactician .    "  I've seen the scars those blessings leave\'85 it's the bravest path one can walk .   "   I nodded , and took the piece of mutton from the fork . \
  "  Can you tell that woman in the white armor to meet me at the hostel later ?  "  \
  "  Of course , Tactician-sama .   "   I looked at her as she used Ilian .  I swallowed the spoonful of porridge .    "  Ilian ?  "  \
  "  Yes , my husband was from the Daein Canton .  We met , and came to the Sacaen ridge to find a peaceful life .   "   She continued to feed me , her husband looking at her with pride and loving .  Kai smiled .  He married her because she was so tender .  They were both past their prime , but he could see the man had been a valiant warrior .  The hetman smiled . \
  "  In my youth , I maintained a forced peace with the bandits around here .  Perhaps you would stay , now that this village is so\'85 alone .  We have no warriors to protect this village\'85 we have no way of staying safe within these walls anymore .   "  \
Kai frowned .    "  Milady is required at the Caelin canton soon , and we can spare no warrior .  Wil would be an excellent addition to our forces , but , if he must , he can say here\'85  "  \
The hetman shook his head .    "  He should go with you .  We have a few strong men in the village , and I know enough of the sword and shield to train them .  However , this is rude of me .  Please , stay as long as you like , Tactician .  Your wounds need time to heal .   "  \
Day 3 of our stay in the village .  Florina had still refused to come and see me , but I had regained some of the motor skills in my hand .  Nightly doses of vulnerary ointment had sped the healing process exponentially .    "  So , Lyn , how was last night\'85  "  \
She looked at me .    "  Kent was wonderful .  He took me for a ride in the twilight\'85 I've never seen the sky so beautiful .  He treated me like a real gentleman .  He even picked me some flowers\'85 funny , how they make a girl feel so\'85 different .   "  \
  "  Well , don't be afraid of them .  But don't let him sweet talk you .  I don't want my main swordswoman getting fornicated , while we're still months away from our goal .   "  \
  "  You know me better than that , Kai .   "  \
  "  Think about it , we've only known each other for about two weeks now , Lyn .  And if my hands weren't so lame , we'd be on our way now .   "  \
Ariana stepped into the modest hut I had set up as a barracks of sorts .  The girls were strictly confined to the left side , and the men to my right , the reason being my right hand was less lame , and able to stop the men more easily .  But luckily , nothing had happened , other than Lyn and Kent riding out last night .  They had returned before the moon was too high in the sky . \
Ariana smiled .    "  Talking about the date ?  "  \
Lyn nodded .    "  Yes , we were .   "  \
  "  Ah , too bad Sain's such a lecher .  He's groped me four times today .  Garnet's been pestering me to tell him off as well .   "   Lyn had been informed , rather untactfully , that garnet was telepathic .  I was still nursing a bruised kidney from it .  I remember like it was yesterday\'85 in fact , it was only the day before , after the feast . \
Garnet giggled to himself , and I picked it up , resting in the hut .  I absently shifted over to him , as he was usually better conversation than most .  However , once I got there , I saw Lyn rather unmercifully groping herself .  And making strange noises .  My jaw dropped . \
  "  I shouldn't be watching this !  "   I said to garnet , but he just laughed .  'So interesting .  Your species can go into heat at any time , and don't even require a mate to mate !'\
  "  It's called masturbation , and it's a way to prevent mating .  She does this , and she's not left to fend off Sain by herself .  It's also a rather enjoyable pastime , if you're enchanted by someone's beauty .   "  \
'Bah , I don't care for the details ! She just smells so\'85 frisky . ' He licked his lips .  'So delectable , so honeyed and sweet !' I just stared at him . \
  "  Surely Ariana has needs .   "  \
'Needs that she goes off by herself and completely locks down to fulfill .  I've only smelled this once , and that was from another wyvern when I was a child . '\
  "  Then they smell the same ?  "  \
'Far and away different .  Humans smell like honeyed almonds , and wyverns like burning roses and hickory .  A sweet yet flavored scent that just drifts along your mind like a graceful hummingbird to the flower . '\
I sighed as I saw her arch , bringing her chest into view .  I gulped and crossed my hands in front of my chest , determined not to indulge myself .    "  Humans are fickle creatures , my dear wyvern .  So utterly driven by emotion are we that at times , we do things in the heat of passion .   "  \
'Not at all like wyverns , who think as they speak .  We are methodical and impassive .  I observe merely out of interest and speculation , while you do it in lust and regret .  There's no need to be sorry , she is a beautiful woman , and quite eligible .  If I was human , I might indulge . '\
  "  You're pretty indulged now if your hips are any sign .   "   I said , looked him in the face and nodding to his hindquarters .    "  You're being aroused , and you don't like to admit that a HUMAN is doing this to you .  Admit it ; you'd love to sire a half breed .   "  \
'Only to sire one , to discover what the beast would look like . ' He stated defensively .  'Knowledge is a tool and a weapon . '\
We looked on unabashedly as she nearly screamed and arched again , spreading herself wider and allowing us a view .  Thank Elimine her eyes were closed .  She bucked a bit as she slowed and continued her ministrations .  Apparently , she was having fun walking that razor thin line , trying to find herself in a blade lined fog . \
I shook my head , clearing it of mist .    "  You're a pervert , garnet .   "  \
'You try not being one when your lady insists on sleeping nearly in the buff right next to you .  I've spent too much time around humans and I know what they feel like , so don't start going all mister   "  I'm too good to be a pervert  "   on me now .  You're just as hypnotized as me . '\
  "  True , but I'm also being modest about it , and speaking of modest , guess who's behind you ?  "  \
He looked back , and snapped his jaw up as Ariana looked at his rather naughty bits with a smirk .    "  Looks like someone's been a bad dragon .   "  \
He looked at me from the corner of his eye , and snarled .  'You'll pay for this . '\
  "  When ?  "   I smirked . \
I felt him stretch his presence .  'Nice looking body Lyn , now just look through the crack in the boards right in front of you . '\
Garnet and I were plainly visible .  She smirked , and stood up , affixing her shirt back , dropping her indulgement away right there .  I paled visibly in my ether state .    "  You're\'85 A cold-hearted bastard , Garnet .   "   She heard me too . \
  "  So it's a peeping dragon and a peeping Kai , is it ?  "   she smirked , and walked towards my shack . \
  "  You do know you've killed me , right garnet ?  "  \
'You don't have to deal with a fourteen year old girl who likes her dragon as more than a friend , from the way she's usually thinking of me . '\
  "  She's also had too little human relation for a girl her age .  It's no surprise she finds Sain attractive .   "  \
I winced as I was forcibly pulled from my ether state by a boot in the chest .    "  I'm sorry !  "   I immediately said , scooting back a bit .    "  I shifted when I heard him giggle !  "  \
  "  Dragons don't giggle .   "   Lyn said with murderous venom dripping from her fangs . \
  "  Telepathic ones do !  "   I said as I saw her brandish her claws ( That is to say , crack her knuckles and glare at me .  )\
  "  Oh , he's telepathic then ? Well why did you not stop Sain from speaking ?  "   just then , Sain walked in , whistling a merry tune .    "  Ah , hello Lyndis .  I trust the walk with Kent went well ? I just saw him by the woods .  He's taking quite a shine to you , you know ?  "  \
Sain was entirely too dense to just act like he had seen nothing if he had .    "  THERE ! That's my proof ! If Sain had seen you doing that , do you not think he would brag , blush , and be propositioning you right now ?  "  \
Lyn looked at me , and kicked me square in the kidney .    "  I'll go speak with Ariana about a suitable punishment then .   "  \
  "  NOT FOR ME !  "   I prayed/screamed .    "  Nope , for the dragon .   "  \
Sain scratched his head .    "  What was all that about ?  "  \
I smiled at the girls .    "  So , I've been meaning to ask you Ariana , what was your punishment for garnet ?  "  \
  "  Oh , just a peepshow to see just how much he was into human females .   "  \
My jaw dropped .    "  You let him watch ?  "  \
  "  Every juicy minute of it .  Florina was most gracious in helping me too .  Ah , you should have seen him .  Stubby little wings tied up to himself\'85 it was a riot\'85 took a lot of rope though .   "  \
I blinked .    "  Tell me you didn't fornicate Florina\'85  "  \
  "  Ewww ! No ! We locked him in a room near the hot springs\'85 I still haven't let him out , and it smells an awful lot like Bernian mustard in there , but , he's not complaining\'85 I feed him twice a day .   "  \
I sighed .    "  Well , for my transgression , I suppose I came out better than he , after all , he was watching the longest .   "  \
Lyn looked at me .    "  How much longer ?  "  \
  "  Apparently from the beginning .  I was only there for the part just before your mystery man apparently either finished himself , or stopped himself to bring your body closer .   "  \
She kicked me in the shin .    "  OW !  "  \
  "  For your information , you've no right inquiring , and it could have been a mystery woman for all you know\'85  "  \
  "  There are two reasons I know why that's a lie .   "  \
  "  Tell me then , mister sage .   "  \
  "  One , you're apparently falling in love with Kent .  Two , whenever you see Florina you become embarrassed , and distance yourself from her .  This is why Florina is so utterly depressed , and quite certainly , suicidal if she still refuses to come see me .   "  \
I took the bowl of porridge from Ariana with grace and nodded my thanks .  She smiled .  Lyn just stared at me . \
  "  I hate you Kai .   "  \
She said this with sarcasm dripping like water from her body .  The thought made my spoon shudder for a moment before I devoured it .    "  I love you too , Lyn .   "   I smiled at her . \
She growled in frustration , and stalked out .  I sat down with Ariana as we ate , and I told her more of the magicks I knew .  She was mostly interested in the Flame magicks , not the tomes I spoke of .    "  The magicks , Kai .  I want to learn the magicks .   "  \
  "  But\'85 they cost your body .  They simply cannot be used in combat .   "  \
  "  NO !  "   She growled .    "  I will learn to perform the magicks that cost my my blood , if only I can be more like garnet .   "  \
  "  There are tomes of fire , lightning , wind , even ice !  "  \
She paled as I said ice .    "  I\'85 will never read from a tome .   "  \
I then remembered .    "  You\'85 can't read , can you ? And you're afraid of ice .   "  \
She nodded quietly .    "  Fine , I'll teach you seven magicks\'85 But I will not teach you any of ice or wind .   "  \
She grinned at me .    "  Thank you !  "  \
  "  But before that , you WILL learn to read tomes .   "   She dropped her eyes and lowered her head .    "  The reason is this , a tome usually contains forty or so , different incantations .  All incantations gather the same energies , without draining your blood , but they do not work unless scribed in the blood of a white wolf .  This supplies the blood required to the magic , and allows it to function .   "  \
She nodded .    "  Then I'll learn to read .   "  \
  "  You will also train in the spear .   "  \
  "  But why ?  "  \
  "  Because you are to be the world's first Dracomancer .   "  \
  "  What ?  "  \
  "  There are magicks in this world far older than humanity .  There is one I know of known as quintessence .  In its basic state , all life is quintessence .  It circulates in your mind , giving you thought .  That is why beasts can hunt in packs .  But garnet is basically , a mass of quintessence .  You will learn to communicate directly with that substance , and in essence , absorb some of it , becoming in effect , part dragon .   "  \
She looked at me as if I were insane .    "  It will be a slow process , taking the better of two years to complete .  But , you will be able to master some of the dragon's abilities .  This will give you more strength , tougher skin , better eyes , and faster reflexes .  But you and garnet will be bound .  Without one half of your quintessence , he will be nothing but a slobbering and most likely murderous , dragon .  You , without half of his , would be frail and brittle , as breakable as a newborn twig .   "  \
  "  The reason I say this is because he is not just a wyvern , he is truly a DRAGON .  At least in part .  And I have a feeling we will meet more like him .  And by tradition , Dragon riders use lances .  By tradition , mages specialize in one type of magic .  You will combine the art of dragon riding , with magic , and tame him , while becoming like him .  A harmonic being , with two bodies but one purpose .   "  \
She looked shocked .    "  You love garnet , as more than just your savior or your caretaker or even your brother .  You love him with all of your heart , and wish he knew just how deeply you cared for him .   "   I smiled . \
  "  You'll show him how deeply you do .  Magicks like this have not been done in millennia .  You'll have a long time to think about it , before it happens .   "  \
She nodded .    "  Go now ; I need some time to think .   "  \
End of day Three . \
A/N : Well well , I've butchered it suitably .  A summer of careful planning all goes to you guys , the reviewers .  It's the beginning of the school year , and I apologize for the wait , but I've had to plan out four or five whole chapters .  Next chapter in Fire Emblem Redux : Dragon blood ( Which I am changing the name too , Effective of this chapter , ) will be the first support chapter . \
Sain sighed as he lifted the barrel of apples , nodding to Kent .  He couldn't keep his mind off of Ariana , or Florina .  Both were so beautiful , but Florina was a bit of a heathen .  He smirked inwardly .  If you wanted to be correct , politically and technically , they both were .  One was a woman who had no idea how to breed and propagate her species ; the other was raised by a dragon who thought he was a human .  Well , half dragon half wyvern , according to Kai . \
\
This didn't matter in the least to Sain .  If Kent could chase a marquess' Granddaughter , he could surely chase after that illusive love bug in a heathen woman , couldn't he ? He dropped the apples by the Hetwoman , and smiled .  He saw a few of the village boys playing with sticks like they were swords .  A few of them stood out , looking as though they had natural talent .  He inwardly began to muse to himself again , as he found himself doing often when he didn't wear his armor .  'Some of those boys must have a warrior's blood in them\'85 Still , this close to Bern and Sacae , I guess it's inevitable .  This far north , it's nothing but frontier .  I suppose I should be thankful that we stopped here .  Great food and good looking women\'85 but I just can't seem to put my eyes on them .  No woman has looked the same sense the luisy bush incident .  First they all looked like trophies or objects to be placed on a mantle , but now that I've met these women I journey with , I can't seem to even comprehend the actual act of sex .  It's strange . '\
Sain didn't really care much for his muse at that point , so he stopped speaking with it .  He walked back towards the bath house , and briefly thought of joining garnet , who was still tied up in the storage shed .  Resolutely looking at the door , trying to prove his dragonish parts .  Sain shook his head in amusement as he entered the changing rooms , which were coed .  He always wondered why the rooms were coed , and the baths not .  Of course , no one got into their skins until they were in the bath , because of that simple fact , and there were cubby holes supplied for the guests to put away their unders .  He sighed , and peeled off the shirt he had been wearing .  A simple white sleeveless undershirt , with his normal green underpants .  His loincloth was soaked as well .  He sighed , and put them into the small wooden trunk he had rented .  He grabbed up a towel and walked in .  Various village men were relaxing after the long day of harvest , but they moved aside and raised a chorus when either he or Kent walked in . \
He took off his loincloth , still embarrassed about himself .  The other men were simply jealous .  The seventeen year old could have used that as a cane if he was their age .  Sain always thought it was just average or small , not as large as it was .  He slipped into the water after putting away his loin cloth into the 'please wash' basket that a man would come and get every day .  He put his towel in a cubby and slipped into the hot water , sighing heavily .    "  I can't see how you guys do this all day ! Running back and forth over seventeen acres of tree and climbing them ? It's enough to make a man mighty tired .   "  \
The men smirked .    "  Well , we don't have to lug around as much luggage as you do !  "   Sain looked at the man who had said it .  The man had scars , and was past his prime , but still looked able to dish out some punishment .    "  What do you mean ?  "  \
Some of them laughed , others just snickered .  Another spoke up .    "  Boy , your pecker is so big a blind man could use it as a cane !  "   The laughed at Sain's expense who blushed redder than a beet .    "  It's nothing to be embarrassed about .  Some men are just better endowed .  You just happen to be endowed like an ox .   "  \
Kent and Wil walked in after that .  Kent smirked .    "  And we in the locker rooms had always ragged him about that .   "   He dropped his loincloth and so did will , each inserting it into the loin cloth basket .  Towels went into cubbies , and they sunk into the water .  Three well muscled men with relatively few scars and nearly fifteen others with scars , muscles , and past their primes all sighed in unison as the flames in the pipes were stoked .    "  I'll have to give that dragon another big steak .  He keeps it nice and warm in here\'85  "   one of the older men said . \
Kent smiled   "  That was his punishment\'85 Watching a woman in her most intimate moments is a dire offense , and Master Kai still catches hell nightly for his part in that little fiasco .   "   Sain and Wil both paled .    "  Don't remind us , that's just brutal\'85  "  \
Wil grinned .    "  What about that Ariana eh ? She's a cute little button ; I would gladly take Kai's place to see THAT .   "   The men in the bath laughed . \
Sain paled .    "  You would do no such thing !  "   he had kept the nineteen year old's nightly fraternizing with the village women to himself .  But he held it like a concealed piece of steak from the hungry lions that could do nothing but smell blood on Wil's head .  And he was close to ripping that piece of cloth off and dropping the steak . \
  "  Ah , and that Florina ! A flower amongst the flowers , I would say ! A spit fire like no other ! As sharp as the taste of well aged cheese , and just a smooth to boot !  "   Wil sighed like a boy in love . \
Sain snorted .    "  You may be more versed in the arts of wooing , my dear archer , but I'd be willing to bet that no woman who ever rode a flying mount would DARE spend her time with an archer .  Too quick to let fly the arrows !  "  \
The men laughed loudly , and Kent smiled .  Score one for Caelin .    "  Don't forget , my friend .  Archers tend to aim high and shoot fast .  I doubt they'd know much of the arts of an Ilian Tea house !  "  \
The howl shook the house , and Wil blushed .    "  BAH ! If women in a Daein Tavern know how to do that , why wouldn't any woman ?  "  \
The man who had commented on Sain from before spoke up .    "  Don't you know ? Daein women are trained from birth ! Too busy trying to live through the next week to reach an age where they can flee from that Marquess' hands to consider how decent it is !  "   The men all nodded sagely .    "  The man gives lechers a bad name .  Hell , if there was a nation of lechers , he'd be the Grand King Puubah !  "  \
Sain nodded .    "  I've heard even his boy is not safe any more .  Found one of those magic women in the woods one day and had his way , and ever sense servants have fled the castle in terror .   "  \
Then men all shuddered , including Kent , Sain , and Wil .    "  Them magic women is a curse , I say ! What man in his right mind would let some witch work magics on his body like that ?  "  \
Kent spoke up next .    "  Back in Caelin , I and Sain knew a man who was changed like that .  He was always a bit strange , but entirely fascinated with breasts .   "   He nodded quiet as Sain picked it up ,   "  Even more than me , and I'm an accomplished breast examiner !  "  \
Wil gagged silently as they continued .    "  One day he was sent out on rounds , and he never came back .  A week later , we came into town looking for some new Tack for our horses .  We saw a Woman who looked just like him , down to the muscles ! We called his name , and lo' and behold , he turned to look at us , then ran like hell in the opposite direction .   "  \
The men shook their heads .    "  I've heard that magic don't work on people who don't want to have it done .   "   Another spoke ,   "  A terrible fate .   "   And yet another .    "  Well , still , he'll make some Dyke a very happy woman !  "  \
This brought the crickets out .  They all looked at the offender .    "  What , I had a woman who liked men and women once\'85 Course , she always found the pure dykes to bring home .   "  \
This brought an understanding nod , and the first of the leavers out .  The loincloths were clean now .  Sain stood up and nodded .    "  I think I'll be going too .  That story always makes my stomach hurt .   "  \
Wil and Kent and a few of the other men nodded .    "  We've all heard the horror stories , and I don't think any of us are going to want that fate .  Best to stop talking about it lest we bring down thunder on ourselves .   "  \
Sain got his loincloth and dried off .  He knew there was a hole in which the women could see into the men's room well enough , and stood before it , drying himself .  He vaguely heard gasps .  He slipped on his loin and stepped into the changing room .  Ariana was getting dressed as well , and she stopped to help Kai with his hands .    "  Well , go on in Kai .  Kent will help you with your Loincloth .   "  \
Sain took her in .  She was so young and beautiful , and only three years different .  Supple curves and quiet angles that lauched your eyes right back into her body .  She was picturesque .  He quickly averted his eyes as he felt his body react , and dashed for his locker .  Lo and behold , it had been switched .  Kai glanced at him with a smirk as he walked in and Florina walked out .  Never had the three been in the same area in this state of undress .  Sain gulped , and saw his green trousers thrown onto of a chest between theirs .    "  Kai , I swear I will kill you .   "   Was all he said as he stepped up to it .  Ariana and Florina both cut eyes at the washboard between them , and he blushed , realizing his penis was once again on the move . \
He gulped , and grabbed his shorts .    "  The Demon has a Demon of his own I see\'85  "   Florina said , giving his loin cloth a meaningful look . \
Ariana giggled .    "  Enough for two or three women at once it looks like .   "  \
Sain blushed redder than a beat as he jerked up his pants , getting something pushed up in the process .  He nearly screamed in embarrassment as he fumbled with it , reddening his own and both girls' cheeks .  He straightened up as he put it away and jerked on his shirt .    "  My apologies ladies .  Kai will get his just deserts for this , I grantee .   "   He walked out of the room . \
Florina talked without making a sound to Ariana .    "  Did you see that ?  "   Her eyes were wide open . \
  "  HUGE !  "   was all Ariana replied , her eyes just as wide . \
Florina nodded , and then continued her talk with Ariana .    "  I'm not like they think I am , you know ? My sisters\'85 they told me that was what sisters do\'85  "   She was referring to the kiss , apparently .  Lyn had avoided her and Ariana had been shy around her .  Come to think of it , the girls in the locker rooms at home had also acted strange . \
Ariana smirked .    "  I don't care .   "   She spoke aloud .    "  It's not my place to judge you .  What you do in your spare time is your own thing .   "   She smirked , and looked at Florina again , speaking without words this time .    "  Besides , my dragon is still bigger !  "  \
Florina paled .  Once again , silent as a mouse .    "  Get out ! He was fricking massive ! Puts my Pegasus to shame when he sees a good looking mare !  "  \
Ariana laughed .    "  Look at us ; we're sitting here comparing a man to animals and dragons ! Honestly , we must be what , twelve ?  "  \
Florina laughed as well .  Men still scared her witless , but she wasn't into girls like everyone seemed to think .  She just used it as a cover ; it was a convenient way to avoid men .  She looked at Ariana .    "  We must be , but honestly , he'd split you in two !  "  \
  "  I don't think he's endowed like that .  I think he's just long .  Very long .  He wasn't even ready to do the tango !  "  \
Florina thought about it .    "  You know , you're probably right\'85 I don't think any God would be cruel enough to give that lecher nothing to work with\'85 too big , and he'll never find a clean woman to father kids , too small , and he wouldn't be any fun , apparently .   "  \
They remembered the women talking .  It was Friday night , and the women were all raring to go for Saturday morning stew .  They hardly ever saw a claimed couple there .  The men were tired from a week of work , and the women were getting lonely .    "  Gods , but the men in the village aren't endowed at all !  "   one of the sluttier young women said .    "  But that Archer ! Ohh is he a man !  "  \
  "  But he doesn't know what he's doing half the time !  "  \
  "  I don't care ; he makes the men in the village seem like little pissants !  "  \
The girls laughed .  But Florina and Ariana looked at each other in shock .  The women had all seen Sain's endowment .  Suddenly , they felt obliged to stake their claim .  Florina was out the door so fast Ariana barely had time to tie her trousers up . \
Sain sighed as he stood in the dark and empty square .  He heard a pattering of feet , and felt something small bump into him .  He turned and grabbed quickly , snatching Florina up .  She had nearly fallen back , but quick reflexes on his part had saved her .  'She must not have her night eyes right now I suppose\'85' he thought . \
Florina smiled graciously .    "  Thanks\'85  "   she said quietly .    "  Suppose you wanted to come to breakfast with me tomorrow\'85  "  \
Ariana got there just in time to see the scene , her being the damsel in distress , him the noble knight .  She felt tears well up unbidden as Florina kissed his cheek .  Ariana walked away then , crying slightly to herself as she headed back towards the makeshift barracks . \
Sain shook his head no .    "  I'm sorry , but I can't .  I have a lot on my mind .   "   Florina pressed her body to his .  Sain was painfully aware of the ache in his thighs , and the two thin layers of cloth between their bodies .  She looked at him with pleading eyes .  Sain was for the first time , nearly petrified .    "  I'm sorry ! I can't do this !  "  \
He let her go and walked away ; leaving Florina flustered , and ready to pounce .  She wanted that man , and she wasn't about to let him get away ! But she could wait until he was feeling a bit friskier .  She could definitely wait . \
Sain sighed as he walked to the back of the shed , and let the dragon out .    "  Come on , let's get you untied .  I think you've had enough punishment for one life time\'85  "   he said as he untied the dragon , and nodded .  Garnet looked at him with respect in his eyes .  He felt the dragon's voice echo much like Kai's .  'I think you're a very good man to deny the women like that .  Though your hands could get a little bit steadier . '\
Sain smiled .    "  Well , once in a lifetime was enough for me .  My hips still ache from that on occasion\'85  "   The Dragon looked at him with a smirk .  'So you WERE raped . '\
  "  Not that I think of it like that , but yes .   "  \
Sain was a pervert , yes , but he was also scared shitless when it came to actually performing the act with a woman .  That Wyvern rider had scared him so badly\'85 nothing but pure animal lust in her eyes , and a sword in her hand , and he had been her slave for nearly three days .  The first several hours were pleasurable .  The next days were horrible .  That still didn't mean he didn't like the feel of a woman's ass in his hand or his hand on their breast .  It just meant he was afraid of hip to hip contact . \
Kent sighed and walked beside him .    "  Still paranoid about Tea houses I see\'85  "  \
Sain looked at Kent .    "  You're the one who saved me from that witch .   "  \
Garnet's eyebrow rose .  Kent sighed .    "  I don't like to remember that\'85  "  \
Sain nodded .    "  I know , but I'm eternally grateful\'85 Sorry I had to do that to you though\'85  "  \
Garnet huffed .  'What's going on here ?'\
Sain looked over at Garnet .    "  You know the story about the Luisy bush incident right ?  "  \
The Dragon nodded .    "  Well , there's a second part we agreed to never speak of .   "  \
Kent sighed .    "  Might as well let the dragon know now , Sain .   "  \
  "  Fine .  Here's how it happened\'85  "   and he began to regale the two with the story , unaware of the ears of a certain sky-blue haired girl around the corner , and a flame red haired one on the other side of her pet dragon . \
It was a stormy night in the Bern Mountains .  General Wallace had Order Sain and Kent to gather wood and find food .  Kent had returned on time .  Wallace was beginning to worry about the journeyman lancer in his ranks , Sain .  He growled .    "  PRIVATE KENT !  "   The Short little red haired teenager rushed up to the brick wall that was Knight Wallace .    "  YES SIR !  "   The Chain mail clad squire stood tall and ready to serve , despite his short stature .    "  Find my page .  His name is Sain .   "   Kent nodded , and dashed off , following the little trail that Sain had left behind\'85 how the Green clothed boy could leave a trail in a storm still remained to be discovered . \
Sain nearly screamed from the agony of it all .  About four hours ago this woman had literally JUMPED him ; knocking his spear away with such force it sprained his wrist .  She had dragged him , kicking and screaming back to her place .  And then she had thrown him on the bed , and thrust her own spear into the door .  There were no windows .  There was no way out , and his wrist hurt .  The first thing she did was hammer his solar plexus , knocking the air out of him .  And then she cut his clothes with a slash of her sword . \
For the first three hours , he had been very interested\'85 then it started to go down hill .  He was beginning to falter , and she was STILL not done .  When he first slackened his pace , she slapped him .  He returned to what she liked .  Again he slowed only minutes later , and then she punched him square in the jaw .  He broke into tears .  She pulled him about like a doll and threw him down , giving herself room to work him back into an unwilling position of weakness . \
Those were horrible hours of pain and torment . \
The rain hammered Kent with such force he was having trouble standing .  But some flame seemed to burn within his stomach .  He was screaming in utter fury at the storm .    "  I WILL NOT FAIL SIR WALLACE !  "   And he trudged on , until he saw his allies spear .  Fear gripped his heart .  He began to look around .  Shortly away , he saw clear signs of a struggle , and then he saw the boy's knife tossed onto the ground , with a bit of blood staining it .  Not enough to say it had cut someone , only enough to say blood had splashed here .  He saw the trail of broken twigs , and he followed it .  He was suddenly afraid . \
Day two .  By this time , she had given her toy a few crumbs of food .  However , he was forced to eat it in between the flashes of pain she continued to give him , and only to please herself .  He didn't know what this was .  Not even his HAZING had been this scary .  And Hazing had been scary ! Very scary , suffice to say it involved brands , needles , ink , and some unremoveable marks .  This was going to leave marks too , but ones which could not be seen . \
Kent was glad of the rain's slackening .  Tracking the abductor of his friend had been hard .  She or He or whatever it was left little trail , but apparently , Sain was still thrashing .  Then he reached a large field .    "  SHIT !  "   he yelled .  He was going to have a hard time finding the way they went . \
Two hours later , he was hungry , but he had found the broken twigs lining the path the kidnapper had taken .  Then he found the river .  He nearly cried .  But he would not fail , he knew resolutely .  He began to search for the path they had taken . \
Day three's dawn .  Kent saw the cottage , and heard the throws of what had to be a woman's pleasure .  He almost took another step , but something bothered him .  There ! A twig , just slightly misplaced\'85 Something odd was going on .  He stalked towards the cabin .  He could vaguely hear sounds of pain . \
Sain cried again .  She had nearly broken his arm with that last squeeze .  He finally spoke up .    "  MERCY ! Woman , are you daft , you're hurting me ! I understand you want me , but woman really ! OW ! AHHHHH !  "  \
Kent nodded .  That sounded like the green haired boy .  He kicked the door in and drew his sword , preparing for a kamikaze charge to save his friend .  He stopped after the first step . \
Sain sobbed .    "  FOR THE LOVE OF ELMINE WOMAN ! PLEASE STOP !  "   He looked over at Kent .    "  OH THANK GOD ! You there , relieve me !  "   The red panted boy just dropped his jaw .    "  Are you Sain ?  "  \
  "  Bloody Hells Yes I am , Private Kent ! Now get over here and Relieve me ! She's neigh broken my hips ! AIE ! WOMAN FOR THE LOVE OF THE GODDESS THAT DOESN  "  T TWIST LIKE THAT !  "  \
Kent watched as she twisted his allies arm into a rather painful position ( And moved her naked body in the obvious throws of pleasure .  For some reason he couldn't misplace the fact that she was screwing his brother in arms .  And he was neither enjoying it nor despising it .  )   "  Hold on , I'll distract her .   "   He looked around , and picked up an armor layered boot .  He flung it as hard as he could , and slammed her in the side of the head with it .  She just looked at Kent with blank eyes , but she stopped moving . \
Sain sighed in relief as she got up\'85 then he howled in utter pain .  His manhood now had air touching it .  The rawness of his entire groin was merely irritated by the dry air .  He tried to curl up , but any movement simply sent agony through him .  He whimpered . \
Kent faced off with the nearly zombified woman .  He stepped in , and slashed , a fine ribbon being drawn across her eye .  He punched her in the solar plexus following that , and for some reason , took note of her blond hair .  He grabbed Sain , and ran out the door as fast as he could , sacrificing his own knife to keep her within the shed . \
  "  Ahhh ! Watch the hindquarters there chum ! They're a little tender !  "  \
Kent nodded   "  Right ! Sorry ! I'll float you down this river\'85 may help\'85 .   "  \
  "  My\'85 how long has it been ?  "  \
  "  Three days .   "  \
  "  You're kidding ! I just went over 200 rounds with a beautiful woman over three days ?  "  \
  "  You've got to be joking ; you talked her into doing that ? It looked , and seemed , like she just kind of\'85 took you and did you .   "  \
  "  Well erm\'85 You see\'85  "  \
  "  So she DID take advantage of you !  "  \
  "  Not so ! She exhibited all the attributes of having eaten a flower of the Luisy bush !  "  \
  "  So , it was a 'Mercy killing' of sorts ?  "  \
  "  If you want t term it like that , yes .   "  \
  "  Have any idea who it was ?  "  \
  "  From the way she carried her self , it was clear she was used to riding a mount , though most likely a flying one .  Also , from the way she spoke , she was clearly Bernian .   "  \
  "  A Wyvern rider ? You just slept with a Legendary ice queen ?  "   he pushed Sain into the cold river , and walked beside the invalid victim . \
  "  Yes , I believe so\'85  "  \
The journey was uneventful until they reached base came .  Kent had just ignored Sain's rather obvious injury .  Sir Wallace was aghast .    "  I had heard of the Wyvern riders going to shacks in the middle of no where for times of extreme duress\'85 but Elimine boy ! That's what she did to you ?  "  \
The whole camp was suddenly in an uproar , and headed back to Caelin .  That was the last border patrol they had gone on for quite some time . \
  "  So that's what happened between me and Kent all those years back , and it's how we became friends .   "  \
  "  He's not grown much , either , in ANY attribute .  Attitude , height , anything , the boy is about as sizable and as mature as he will ever be .   "   Kent ruffled Sain's hair . \
Ariana walked out from behind the bushes , intending to pretend she was going to give garnet more talking to .  But she instead walked right to Sain .    "  Thanks for letting Garnet out\'85 if I had done it , he might start giving me those puppy dog eyes again .  Thanks for everything , Mister Demon .   "  \
For some Reason , Sain felt\'85 Proud .    "  You're welcome , Angle .   "  \
She nodded , and grabbed garnet's scruff , tugging him along .  He almost seemed scared . \
Florina was burning underneath her clothes .  She was liable to explode into flames she was so hot , and angry .  That little BITCH ! She dared to hit on HER man ? She would pay , OHHHH She would pay . \
I snickered .    "  So that's what happened , eh ?  "   I grinned , and walked back towards the Barracks .    "  Well there's some meat on those two\'85 maybe I can use it\'85  "   Of course , I had the bad luck to step on Lyn's foot .  She happened to be leaning up against the tree .  Naked .  DAMNIT !\
WOOSH ! WHAP ! THUD ! SMACK !   "  OW !  "  \
Kent and Sain looked over towards the woods .    "  What was that ?  "  \
Wil dashed out of the woods , apparently cleaning himself up .    "  You don't want to know .   "  \
Lyn screamed in anger .    "  PERVERT !  "  \
  "  I SWEAR ! I wasn't watching Lyn ! I promise ! I wouldn't do something like that !  "  \
She snarled at me , and I screamed like a little sissy .  I then proceeded to have my ass kicked like never before .  This was going to be a LONG night . \
\
Nothing like seeing a man beaten within an inch of his life .  Still , Lyn IS female , and so far , she's had two of her more private moments interrupted .  And yes , I know people are gonna be like   "  Omfg ! This is SOOO nc-17 , you little pervert !  "   and then some are gonna be   "  Omfg , I can't get the image of Sain's Wang out of my head ! AHHH !  "   and still others will be   "  Using the same joke twice ? Unoriginal .   "   But you know what ?\
\
I don't care ! HAHAHA ! Lyn shall continue masturbating and something bad will befall her every time ! BWAHAHAHA ! smacked\
Lyn : he's lying of course\'85 if I don't get some me time , and soon , I swear to god , Arimadios , I will kick the living SHIT OUT OF YOU !\
\'85 Uh right\'85 She'll have much lemony goodness next time I decide to write an SC .  Basically , Support chapters are going to be rated M+ for a lot of reasons .  Carry on soldier ! ( P . S .  I'm too lazy to play the game right now .  The sooner someone tells me chapter 4's bosses name , the sooner I can get them to pwning faces , eh ? I'll play it\'85 eventually .  I just don't wanna ! )\
God ye good eve . \
A/N I just now looked at the title of the chapter 4 mission .  It's listed as   "  In Occupation's Shadow .   "   As well\'85 Very VERY strange .  Anyway , here we go . \
\
Lyn and Kent were the last to leave .    "  They bid us a fond Farewell , but , they warn us against staying at the nearby fort tonight .  They say a Banshee has haunted it .  She wails at night crying one strange sounding name .   "   She shrugged .    "  As long as it isn't calling Sain or Kent , I think we're safe .   "  \
\
Sain and Kent both glared at Wil .  He had gotten off scott free the other night , while Kai was nearly dead in his saddle .  I merely just groaned my approval .    "  Lesh gosh .  .  .   "   She had nearly broken my jaw .  She had in fact , sprained it .  I never knew it was possible . \
Every step my horse took was an hour of pain condensed into one second .  I kept the groaning to a minimum .    "  Ow\'85  "   I managed to say clearly . \
  "  I suppose that will keep you from peeping on me again\'85  "  \
I sighed , and stop screaming in my head , and reached across the group .  'Ariana , take my mount .  Garnet , please carry me . '\
'Oh no , Kai , I've learned my lesson , I'm not to associate with perverts !' I fixed the dragon with a glare that said 'Do it or I will burn you to ashes with one of my Blessings . '\'85 He did it . \
I laid down on the back of the Young Dragon and moaned as I was carried inches off the ground with his delicate flying .  'Much better\'85'\
Kent was the first to notice .    "  Commander , Your voice is\'85 Well , it's VERY weak .   "   Sain nodded as well .    "  I've been wounded in much the same way before ; it does tend to scramble your thoughts .   "  \
I sighed , and strengthen my voice , sitting up rather painfully .  'You see , my Blessings are directly linked to my body , and therefore yours , through your Service to Lyn .  The power comes from Heaven , to me , through Lyn , to you .  Thus why I take extra care of Lyn in battle . '\
Lyn snorted   "  Yeah right , you just like to gawk at my naked flesh .   "   She smirked .  I stopped the dragon , and got up , walking straight towards her .  Kent and Sain were Aghast , and Ariana was hopping off the horse to run to me .  Wil was just dumbfounded .  Florina , of course , snickered . \
I punched Lyndis Caelin straight in the face and off her horse .    "  STUPID GIRL !  "   I yelled , even with my sore jaw .  My voice came out of my mind again .  'How can you be so Elimine Damned IGNORANT ! Stop acting like you're some brutal Savage raised by the Taliver Den Mothers ! You are a Lady of a Canton Court ! You are soon to be the Sole Living heir of that court , if you do not straight up and listen to me .  Lyndis , I would not lie to you . ' There was pain in my eyes , I could tell . \
'Your uncle is poisoning your grandfather .  You know this as well as I do .  Anyone can see that his Death is not natural .  Lord Hausen will not want a Foolish Sacaen Nomad ruling over his Canton when he died . ' I snarled .  'Seeing you like this\'85 he would drink the poison straight , if for only to get YOU out of the will . '\
'You are a damned fool .  Listen to me .  Do not think I am some perverted teenager ; do not think I am some wizened sage .  But I AM the Strategist of this army .  You are the Commander and MY charge .  If I so chose , I could send them all into the depths of hell my using the Blessing of Mercy .  But I could not do that to you , because you are what gives me the power I have .  My relationship with you determines how much damage I take using my blessings .  If I love you too much , my hand will fall off by using Savior .  Not enough and it will as well .  The best thing for us to be is the best of friends , like brother and sister . ' I coughed a bit , spitting the pinkish liquid out of my mouth .  Garnet came to me as did Ariana , and laid me back onto our dragon .  'Garnet , take me to the Fortress . ' I looked at the group .  'I expect you all there soon .  Within the day .  Give Lyn a Vulnerary , and take your lunch now .  I'm leaving now . '\
The flight was long , but it was not painful Garnet spoke up first\'85 'Could you\'85 even kill me , as we are right now ?' I shook my head . \
'No , garnet , I couldn't .  Only if you were near Death , or if you betrayed Lyn .  But if you were going to betray her at all , I would know beforehand\'85'\
'How ?'\
'I can see through the eyes of my men and women .  They will have some sort of\'85 Feeling to them , is all I can say .  Their eyes will be a bit blurry , and hard to read the world from .  When I project , I have to tie a lifeline of sorts onto those I am projecting too .  They become my five senses but retain their free will .  In a sense , I haunt them . '\
He nodded as he began to circle the fortress .  'I see\'85 so , the more distracted they are\'85' I nodded .  'The less useful they are to me .  We are not bandits who charge head long into battle .  We are a group of warriors with a common goal .  It's hard to bring a group like this together , and sometimes , I must be very sneaky in the background to bring the group together .  The closer knit a little group is\'85 the better it is for the army .  Instead of being a full force of warriors , we are rebels in the face of the world .  We must use the land for ourselves . '\
The dragon stayed silent as we landed , and he carried me within the Fort .  He walked towards the back room .  We heard the soft breathing of inhabitants .  He peeked around the corner , and then walked forward a bit .  A single woman was sleeping on the tiles in the middle of the room .  Garnet snuffed in distaste .  'It smells like sickness in here\'85'\
I nodded .  'Because she is sick .  This must be the Banshee of the Fort .  She's sick , and screams when she is in pain .  The walls distort it , and make it sound like a Banshee's wail . ' I rolled off of Garnet as he laid down to let me . \
  "  Well well\'85 It seems this dragon is preparing himself a feast .   "   I heard the voice in the room , and looked around .  Garnet tensed .  I felt around but drew a blank .  I saw the mercenary walk out of the shadows .  He wasn't exactly that tall , but he had muscles .  A good deal more than Kent , or Sain .  He carried himself with a fine grace , which seemed to speak of confidence , deserved or not .    "  Imagine my surprise when I see this young lady sleeping in this broken down fort .  And then I see something that flies like a Pegasus with no rider sweeping in , carrying a clearly injured man .   "   He sighed . \
  "  Looks like it's time to slay a baby dragon before it grows up !  "   he drew his sword quickly .  I held my hand up and placed it on Garnet .  He Relaxed at my touch , and sat back , his tail wagging somewhat like a puppies .  'Just defend against him , Garnet .  Don't attack , he thinks you're something that your not . '\
The young man leapt into the air .  His iron sword was nothing to be scared of for Garnet , who just snapped his teeth around it and yanked it free , tossing it aside .  He glared at the mercenary .    "  Young man\'85  "   I said quietly . \
He looked at me , not a bit of awe on his face .    "  You can't have been who was talking to the dragon\'85 He wasn't wounded .   "   He frantically looked around . \
  "  Calm down\'85  "   I said , and then looked at him while I got a fix on his location with my projection .  I let my spirit do the talking for me .  'Look , this dragon is the steed of one of my Women-at-arms .  If anything happened to this wyvern , I'd be in some deep shit .  He carried me here at my behest .  My name is Kai , Strategist of Lyndis' Legion . '\
He nodded dumbly as he could vaguely see my ethereal shape beside the dragon .  'Get your sword and sit guard with this dragon .  If you see a group of people approaching , ask the dragon if he feels snow coming . ' I explained it to garnet at the same time .  'If he does , he'll nod .  If it's not , he'll come back inside and get me .  You're to carry the woman to safety .  Follow the road towards Bern , and you'll find my group .  Ask for Kent .  Tell him that Kai has sent you . '\
I supposed I cut a powerful figure , because with that , Garnet went outside the door , along with the Mercenary .  I passed out . \
I awoke to the smell of roasting antellius .  I stood up slowly and staggered out the door .  The woman had gotten up before me .  I Looked out , and saw Sain and the Mercenary from earlier sizing each other up .  Ariana and Florina were gawking at them .  Mostly at Sain .  He and the other were in nothing but Tank tops and trousers .  Kent and Lyn were sitting beside each other on a log , talking like old friends .  Wil was taking care of the sick woman .  Garnet nudged my arm from just outside the main door .  I smiled , and patted his nose . \
The dark-blue clothed man was down in nothing but his trousers and his shirt , the same as Sain .  They were having an arm-wrestling match on mid air , eyes cold as steel .  For some reason , I couldn't shake the image of two teenage boys wrestling over whom got to take which girl to the Ball\'85 The image seemed to fit .  His hair was\'85 rather spikey .  I anted to say something but a voice deep inside began pleading with me .  I decided zipping it was the best action .  The day's events were coming to a close .  I coughed a little , the activities stopped . \
  "  Morning\'85  "   I muttered .  Kent was the first to address me .    "  Ah , Lord Kai , Allow me to introduce Hiiro Zabukai .  He's a mercenary from a nearby village .  Seems he was told NOT to go looking for this ladies wife and he still did .   "  \
  "  Probably lost my post because of it .  Damned old coot , if he could see what a fighter I really am , he'd understand that I'm not just some simple peasant with a sword !  "  \
Garnet snickered quietly .  I vaguely heard the mental word 'spikey\'85' float through the air .  Hiiro immediately looked at me .    "  Got a problem with my hair ?  "   I pointed at Garnet , and muttered something , though not even I'm sure what it was . \
He snorted .    "  So , I'm supposed to believe the DRAGON is telepathic ?  "   he snickered as he said dragon .  He saw garnet start up the camp-fire , apparently .    "  Look at the big bad commander blaming the helpless dragon pup for his own mouth .   "   He snorted .    "  Disgusting , old man .  You don't even have the balls to fess up for what you said !  "  \
I snarled .  Lyn looked at me with worry .  I stopped quickly , and sighed behind my teeth .  If Lyn was worried about me , she must have snapped out of her rage .  My ribs felt a little better , but the pain in my jaw hadn't gone away .  Legs still hurt too .  Ariana was the first to speak up .    "  Hiiro , leave him alone .  Can't you see he's hurt ?  "  \
  "  No way , I want him to grow a pair .  He doesn't have a single bandage on him except for his hands , and he acts like he's been through a damn war all alone !  "   he snorted , not noticing Lyn look away and close her eyes .    "  He thinks he can get away with whatever he wants to , whenever he wants .  Probably some spoiled Etrurian noble's illegitimate brat ! You can't get away with shit like that here !  "  \
Kent and Sain stepped towards him in unison as he ripped the bandage from my hand .  He stumbled back .  I held up the bared hand in a move to stop them .    "  Kid\'85 Look me in the face .  You see this hand ? This is what happens when you help someone in your traveling group stay alive .  Do you know how magic works ? It requires blood .  A prayer requires sacrifice .  I combine the two , by praying to Elimine to grant me the spell I need in my time of duress , sacrificing my own flesh and blood so that my fellows may live .   "  \
I smirked .  Then dropped it , as it hurt like hell .  My hand looked somewhat akin to have been put through a meat grinder .  But the bones were still in Tact .    "  The hands are the most important thing for a Warrior .  Therefore , if I ask for a blessing onto a warrior , my hands will be wounded .  Onto a mage , and it will be my legs .  Onto Lyn , and it will very likely be both my hands and my heart .   "  \
I sat down on the log .    "  Return when you at least have the decency to not insult a man who is wounded .   "   And with that , Kent and Sain grabbed him up by the arms , while Florina carried his armor .  They flung him out of the light of the campfire roughly .  She tossed his armor and his sword to him .    "  Don't ever insult my commander , brat .   "   She said very firmly , and turned promptly to the fire , walking like she wanted to prove a point . \
I sighed .    "  So what did I miss ?  "  \
Sain spoke first .    "  He seemed very nice .  He was standing guard with Garnet , though he was absently talking to him .   "  \
Garnet snuck closer to the fire , placing his head in Ariana's lap and curling around her so she could lean back .  He spoke up next .  'He didn't realize that I was replying to him .  He kept thinking , 'That's probably what the dragon would say . ' After I spoke to him , almost like he was listening but not comprehending what was happening . ' The half-dragon moved his wings in a vaguely shrug-like gesture . \
I nodded .    "  So , Lyn , have you thought about what I said ?  "  \
She nodded solemnly .  She stood up .    "  I need to talk to you alone .   "  \
I nodded , and stood slowly , looking at the strange woman .    "  Before I go talk with my Lady , what would your name be ?  "  \
  "  Natalie\'85  "  \
I nodded , and walked towards Lyn who stood on the edge of the firelight .  She stood there looking like she had before we started this journey , unsure and afraid .    "  I'm\'85 sorry , Kai .   "  \
I shook my head .    "  There's no need to be sorry .  You've seen some things that\'85 not many people see .  You've done things most Paladins fear to even think of .   "   I sighed .    "  You shouldn't be afraid .  Or unsure .  You're doing the right thing , but you have to understand\'85  "  \
  "  You're not invulnerable\'85 You're flesh and blood and bone , just like me .  You're \'85 Human .  You're not some guardian angel .   "  \
I hesitated slightly .    "  Heh\'85 if I was , I would never leave you alone .  Be glad that I'm not .  Because then I would have nothing to sacrifice for these blessings .   "   I shook my head .    "  As strong as I am , I need to draw on your strength as well .  For all intents and purposes , you're my\'85 Well , for lack of a better word , you're my soul-mate .  But , I'm forbidden to touch you .  I'm forbidden to feel anything but love for you , but I can't love you .  You have to understand , For all intents and purposes , I'm your brother .   "  \
  "  I\'85 don't understand\'85  "   she looked at me like I was crazy . \
  "  My power comes from three places .  Elimine , blessed as she is , my own blood as a sacrifice , and you as the cipher .  Elimine gives me permission to use one of her blessings at the price of my own blood , but ONLY if it used on you , or someone else who carries my amulet .   "   I lightly ran a finger around my Heaven Seal .  It was pulsing again .  Something would happen soon .    "  Basically , carrying that amulet makes you a gateway into this world for Divine power .  My blood may be within it , but , it is Elimine's power .  Everything I have , I owe to her .   "  \
Suddenly , Lyn reached for her sword and I felt a sharp pain in my arm .  I heard my heaven seal pulse , and felt the hot glow on my leg .  As I began to fade out , I felt the blood of the man splash upon me , and I heard Lyn yell   "  TO ARMS ! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK !  "   in the distance I heard a voice scream   "  GANELEON !  "  \
Hiiro heard the scream .  He didn't know why , but he turned around , and threw his sword over his shoulder , running for all he was worth in the pale morning light .    "  Don't worry , I'm coming\'85  "   he said to no one but himself . \
The camp scrambled .  The fire was kicked out by garnet as he tugged Ariana onto his back , grabbing up the parcel of armor that was Florina's .  Her sharp whistle brought her Pegasus out of the nearby field and they dashed inside .  Kent grabbed up his sword , and whistled , his mare , Kunoichi , came running up beside him .  Sain's Stallion was of course , hot in pursuit .  Wil stepped into the fort , and readied his arrows while dragging Natalie into the safety of the stone ruins .  Kent was on his horses back before Lyn could even get a good start on the bandits .  He rode Kunoichi hard , stopping the mare quickly to grab Lyn up and pull her on the back .  She grabbed for Kai as the bandit began to bring his axe down for the felling blow\'85\
Black\'85 nothing but pitch black surrounded me\'85 but I could somehow see .  A Blue figure was dragging me away , her blade coming up to met an axe and it was shattered as her blade sliced through and into the brigand's face , killing him quickly .  I was being pulled again .  Something red , a blur , rode up .  I could see four legs , but nothing else .  He grabbed up my savior and I wanted to scream no as I felt the blackness closing in .  But out of the darkness came a green blur .    "  FOR CAELIN !  "   I heard as brightly as if it were in my ear .  I could see Sain's face as he drove his lance through the man , lifting him off the ground and causing his axe to cleave into his leg from the sheer force of the blow .  The spear was firmly lodged where the black shadow's heart should be . \
Quickly , the blade of the spear lunged upward as the man was pulled underneath the warhorses feet .  He quickly grabbed me up as I reached for the man on the horse , though his name escaped me .  I could only think of one name for this savior .  Demon .  I felt the darkness surround me once again . \
Lyn was shouting orders as they garrisoned the fort quickly , Sain putting Kai down on the ground beside Natalie , who immediately began to patch his wounds .    "  I'll defend our flank .  Wil , Patrol the area , Florina as well .  The leftmost edge of the fort looked weak .  They might try to bust it down .  Sain , Kent , Maintain the front entrance , the back is sturdy .  They won't be able to get in , so those two will be safe .   "   She nodded slowly .    "  I'll take the right flank .   "   She dashed off towards the right side of the fort .  Natalie stopped her though .    "  If\'85 If you see my husband , his name is Dorcas .  He wears a dirty brown tunic .  He carries an axe his father gave him , and he's very accurate with it when he throws .  Don't fight him , tell him Natalie is inside .   "  \
Lyn nodded her acceptance , and dashed off towards the right side , standing at the edge of the door .  The morning light allowed her to see out .  Innumerable men stood outside , smirking at her . \
Sain looked out and dodged another arrow as he slipped his last gauntlet on .    "  There\'85 .  Whoa !  "   he ducked down as an arrow struck sparks on the stone beside his head .    "  Too many to count\'85 Elimine , I'd give my left nut to be back in that cabin right now\'85  "  \
Kent smirked .    "  Even with the rawness ?  "  \
Sain frowned .    "  You have a good point there .   "   He pulled his sword as he took a brief look again , and held it in his left hand .    "  Looks like quite a few axe men , and not a few archers .   "   They heard the sound of crumbling stone and Ariana frowned .    "  They're busting down the western wall !  "   Garnet snarled and went back to the doorway to the middle of the fort .  Ariana followed slowly and took out her spear , but garnet pulled it away .  He nudged the book closer to her .  Kai had been teaching her the words on its pages written in the dark red ink . \
  "  But I can't read Garnet !  "   He fixed her with a stare , and she nodded .    "  Well , if you think I can , then I can !  "   The defense was ready . \
Wil and Florina stood ready as the last blow crumbled the wall .  He sighted down the arrow\'85 he inhaled completely .  He waited\'85 The man dashed in wielding his axe with a berserker's cry .  The shaft of the arrows flew from the bow , and passed cleanly through the man's trachea .  He gurgled slowly before he fell back , the arrow sticking out the back of his neck , directly through the bone .  Florina was next , the high ceilings of the place allowing her Pegasus room to swoop .  Her lance was slim , but it was light , and as she dove on her flying mount , the swordsman who turned the corner had no chance .  The lance punctured his lung on her first clean pass , and ripped out from between the lungs .  He fell to ground in agony .  Her mount rose into the air and spun , before rushing back at the man .  Her lance ripped into the back of his skull , and with a sickening rip , it came clear of his body , aided by an arrow just moments before piercing his throat . \
Sain rode his mount out in front of the door , angling his spear to take the unarmed man in the chest .  It did so , but did not rip , or break .  He dragged the man with him towards Kent .  As they passed each other , Sain ripped free the spread by stopping his mount , flinging the nearly dead man forward , slinging him free of the spear .  His sword was in his left hand , and it ripped into the next man's arm and cut through like butter . \
Kent was doing much the same , but not stopping with one .  He was riding out into the fray , his mare dancing around , kicking and whinnying as his blade flashed around him in a circle .  Flowing blood circled the red armored man as if he were walking in a sea of the dying , his horse started to retreat as he felled the fourth in a row .  She ran inside and he looked at the arrow sticking from her hind-quarters .  He snarled .    "  They got Kuno .   "  \
Sain slapped another with the flat of his spear and jammed his sword through the man as his axe reeled back .    "  A few have glanced me and my stallion as well !  "   he snarled as another tried to flank him , his horse bucking at the sight .  When the horse came down , Sain's spear was through the man from shoulder to stomach . \
Lyn was having equal difficulty .  But there were fewer charging in .  And then she saw him , hefting his axe .  The cloth tied about the base and his wrist unwound a bit as he reared back , and threw the weapon .  The sound of cloth whistling in air cut in twine was a fearsome one .  Lyn ducked down as the axe man swung horizontally .  Her luck was to have the axe-thrower's weapon cut the man's arm off , sending the still moving axe and severed arm around the corner , cleaving into another's shin .  She grinned as the both howled and her blade came up in an arc , cleaving both the man's leg and the cloth from the thrown axe , in two . \
She grinned lightly as he hefted the much heavier axe in his other hand .    "  I'm sorry I have to do this\'85 but I need the money .   "   He hefted the axe high , and brought it down in a crescent with one hand .  She merely stepped aside , and slapped his with the flat of the Mani-Katti . \
  "  You must be Dorcas .   "   She said as he tried to bulldozer her .  She once again sidestepped .    "  Maybe .   "   He ripped the axe out with a spin of his arm and slashed sideways .  She back flipped away from it . \
  "  So I suppose you don't care\'85  "   she said as she stepped forward , her sword biting into the wood of his axe's handle and her knee coming to meet his stomach , eliciting a grunt .    "  That we're protecting Natalie\'85 .   "  \
He stopped completely .    "  Natalie's here ?  "   Lyndis nodded quietly .  He smirked and pulled his axes free , smiling .    "  Looks like daddy's got a new job .   "   He turned around , and walked towards the door leading out .  A swordsman stepped in and raised his eyebrow .    "  I knew you were Soft , Dorcas , but really , the bitch just tried t-  "   He was silenced in a shower of blood as an axe flew clean through his neck without him having time to see the throw .  The cloth on the axe was pulled and it came spinning back into his hand .  He smirked .    "  Yeah , but you knew my wife was here .   "   He walked out of the door . \
The small geyser of blood died down as the headless body fell to its knees .  Lyn felt a little sick as she saw the head of the man blink with the realization that he was dead . \
Hiiro charged towards the main gate of the fortress , cutting one of the brigands in his way in two .  He leapt towards the main gate , and came down harshly , his sword biting into the back of another mercenary who didn't have the privilege of decent chain-mail .  His back split open like a butterfly shrimp as Hiiro rolled into the main of the room and panted .    "  Sorry I'm late !  "  \
Sain and Kent looked to each other .    "  Apology accepted .  Now let's turn the tides in this .   "   The three stepped out in front of the door .  Kent and Sain had dismounted out of fear for their mounts , because of their wounds .  Sain smirked as an arrow spat rock shards at his face as it collided with the stone .  A ribbon of blood oozed down his face .  Kent merely smiled as he shook some of blood from his sword .  Hiiro looked between them and smiled , hefting his own broader iron sword onto his shoulder .    "  Thirty to one odds guys\'85  "  \
Sain looked at him and smirked .    "  You're right .   "   He placed his spear over his back and drew his backup dagger .    "  My spear WAS kind of unfair .   "  \
Hiiro grinned .    "  To the butcher's work then .   "  \
Wil loosed another arrow .    "  Florina , go get me some more arrows ! I'm running low here , and you're faster !  "   She nodded quickly as he feathered yet another intruder .  There was a veritable sea of blood running around the rubble of the wall .  He stayed on his knee , and smirked , feeling the blood soak into his pants .  It didn't make him feel like a cold murderer , but it did make him remember his roots , hunting for southern Elk in the Daein forests . \
Ariana stepped out of the door way as Florina whipped past .  She ran to the main door and looked out .  The Fort was becoming quieter and quieter .  She saw a green blur amongst the sea of red mist .  Kent's one sword was dicing any who dared stray within it's boundaries as he practiced an Ilian art known as   "  Kata of the Falling Leaf .   "   More or less , it was a dance of death .  The one sword would cleave ribbons of blood into anything that strayed to near its path .  Hiiro was back she saw , his broadsword swung in great paths that left men fleeing from its massive range .  If one would try to run , he would leap into the air and come down with his blade from a summersault , and cleave the man neatly in two , splattering blood across the field .  The young man had been trained formally .  But what really caught her eye was her demon . \
Sain was moving quickly , taking powerful slashes and defending with a dagger .  His lance was thrown across his back , and he was smirking from behind the blood that covered his face .  A brigand would make a short leap to cut through Sain , but the green armored demon would have none of it .  His dagger came up into the axe with such force , from his BLINDSIDE , that the axe would be shoved back .  And in a quick spin , Sain cut into his side , the sharp blade of his sword cutting the man free of his legs , while he jammed the dagger into the man's face .  The scream of pain was cut short by the swift removal of the dagger and a spin , slashing the vocal cords of his foe , and blocking another axe in one swift movement , this time his fist would knock the axe away , and his sword would sink into the stomach of his foe and rip up , popping the man's ribs in two , leaving a gaping hole where his innards should have been .  She was Fascinated . \
Florina flew by , taking a moment to spot Hiiro leaping into the air .  His sword came down with enough force to cut the next man's back open like a clam being split .  His sword came out with a curve and he cut two stunned axe men across the stomach , smirking as their bellies emptied of their guts .  She flew on , and dropped their extra quiver down beside Wil .    "  Only 45 arrows ?  "   She drove her Pegasus down and rammed her spear through another man's arm , bringing the blood gushing like a fountain .  Another arrow whizzed by and buried it's self in his heart .  She could see the bones shatter and shards of the newly shattered ribcage shoot out of his back from the force of the arrow . \
  "  It was all we had .   "   She screamed as an arrow shot into her arm .    "  AHH !  "   her Pegasus bucked as she flew off the back of the Pegasus-Mare , and she started to fall .  Her Pegasus swooped about as fast as it could , coming down and catching her inches from the ground . \
Wil nearly panicked .  He was in truth , scared of other archers .  He grabbed the flying-mare's reigns and led her around the corner .    "  HELP !  "   he yelled .  He pulled an arrow from his quiver and cursed .  He hadn't picked up the other .  He turned out around the corner , loosing his arrow hastily , and cleanly missing the other archer .  The foe's arrow had been loosed already , and fount its head buried nicely in Wil's leg .    "  DAMN !  "   he yelled . \
Hiiro heard the commotion .  Sain was about to rush back , when Hiiro shook his head .  Sain nodded , and dashed to the middle of the space between him and the mercenary , inhaling deeply .  Kent also took up slack , moving his whirling blade and footwork towards the middle of the two groups .  Sain wiped blood from a slash on his face .  Kent ignored the dents in his armor from a faulty step and getting caught with an axe .  He stopped his Kata , and stood at the ready with his sword , taking a grip on the slightly longer handle , and smiling .    "  I suppose this might be the end , my friend .   "  \
Sain smirked .    "  Nah , I don't think so .  After all , I'm still scared of women .  Let's not break our pact .   "   Kent smiled and nodded .    "  Then I guess we can't die .   "  \
  "  We're not allowed to .   "   Together , they stood tall , and held their weapons .  Sain stood tall with his sword and dagger , while Kent held his iron sword like it was an Ilian Katana .    "  FOR CAELIN !  "   they yelled together and charged the enemy ranks . \
Hiiro used the blood on his boots to allow him to slide into the hall of the fort , and Dashed towards the west side .  He saw the other archer standing above Wil , pulling back the string .  The dark blue chain mail barely made a sound as the mercenary charged towards the archer , his sword out and ready to slice .  The archer barely looked up as Hiiro's great-sword like weapon cut through his foe , the bow and arrow falling in two as the blade bit into the man's elbow and ran out , cutting along the bone , filleting most of his forearm and cutting his upper arm open like a muffin .  He slid on his blood soaked boots , and the blade continued to flow over his foe's body , all while Florina looked on in awe .  It followed along the collar bone's path until it exited half way out of the archer's neck .  Hiiro kicked the wall , and was surprised to see that it suddenly found traction again , and propelled him towards the other wall in the long hall of rubble and corpses .  His sword spun with him , and caught the archer in the side of the head , cutting into his temple and breaking through the skull , leaving a pale grey organ exposed , even as blood oozed over it . \
The archer fell as the mercenary kicked off the other wall , and spun , going for the last living thing in the hall .  A single swordsman hefted his own great sword and smirked , ready to cut the high flying young man in two .  But his foe failed to realize something .  The building's roof had tried to collapse , just behind Hiiro , and he kicked off of it , driving his body towards his foe .  The other mercenary gawked as Hiiro closed his eyes and began spinning . \
A man's stomach provided surprisingly little resistance to a great sword when it is coming at him at nearly one hundred horse-lengths a minute .  ( 100 MPH .  ) Add this to the fact that it was now rotating at something close to the speed of a drill\'85 You get the picture .  Wil was shocked to see what had happened .  The man's stomach was not simply driven through , it was drilled away .  Blood and flesh showered the walls and floor as the blood-covered mercenary drove himself into his foe .  The gaping hole could not have been bigger if the man had been hit by a ballista .  Hiiro rolled as he came in contact with the stunned man's body , and hit his feet on the ground , leaping up in the air . \
The unfortunate axe-man had been trying to run away from this new demon that bounced off of walls and drilled holes in men .  The dark blue cloth looked to him like a grim reaper as he turned . \
Hiiro used the momentum from the roll to leap into the air , and he came down with his sword between his legs .  He was slightly off center of the man .  His feet hit the man's shoulder and he jammed the sword down .  It did not cut through both side of his body like Hiiro had supposed it would .  Instead , it cut into his body much like a sword in a stone .  The blade could be seen just behind the brigand's eyeball , and erupting out of his face just below there , plunging into his body , and cutting through the lowest points of the well-exercised man's abdomen . \
Unfortunately , the man had fallen to his knees , and so when this blade exited the man's leg , it collided with the ground .  A blade can only take so much stress before it breaks .  And it deiced to break now .  At the collision with stone , the blade sang its protest , and the hilt decided to break off .  Hiiro , with all his forward momentum , ended up being flung across the exit of the place with a yelp .    "  AHH !  "  \
Lucky for him there were plenty of dead or dying men and plenty of blood to break his fall .  Of course , that didn't stop him from eventually hitting the ground , and the blood was quite slick , enabling him to skid towards the rear wall of the fort . \
Hiiro sat up slowly .    "  Whoa\'85 .  Damn that was cool .   "   He got up , and nearly fell again amongst all the blood .  He careful walked across the dying men , using them like stepping stones to avoid the slippery floor , not that the men were any less slippery .  He stopped as he passed the man he had drilled through , and grabbed up the great sword his foe had wielded .  It was a bit heavier , but it was still wonderful .    "  A steel blade huh ? Not even used either !  "   He smiled . \
The wounded Florina had watch this all with her jaw nearly touching the floor , and Wil was just amazed .  Hiiro stopped and helped them up .    "  Come on ; let's get you two patched up .  I don't think anyone else will want to come through that way . \
The silent effigy of the impaled man looked out at his comrades ; the broken great sword impaled through his body did indeed deter other intruders . \
Lyn was outside the fort now , with Dorcas .  Her sacred blade was lodged into one man's spine in a flash , and Dorcas was bringing his axe down on another with a grunt .  His left handed toss of his hand-axe cut into another's chest with a dull THUD .  Lyn pulled his sword free , and spun , reflecting the light of the sun off the blade .  It was only after she realized the sun wasn't up enough to produce a blinding burst that she wondered how it happened , but it had , and the axe-man in front of her paid dearly for it .  Her blade sang in the air as it swiftly fell from the top of its arc , cutting cleanly down the front of the man .  A moment afterwards , his right side fell forward and his left side backwards .  Lyn could swear she didn't cut him that deeply . \
Dorcas was swinging his axe like a wild man , cutting clean through anything that got in his way as he yanked his throwing ace back with the cloth .  They continued to cut their way south from the doorway . \
Carjiga snarled .    "  DAMNIT ! That's it , bring up our special friend .   "   His minion stuttered .    "  B-b-but s-sir ! We're not sure it won't turn on us !  "  \
  "  We captured it , didn't we ? We can kill it if it does turn !  "   The archer nodded to the man , and he ran backwards towards the large men holding the beast down .    "  Let it lose towards the fort .   "  \
Garnet sniffed the air .  He smelled something unnatural .  A mix between a Pegasus's stench and a wyvern's aroma .  He dashed towards the main gate . \
Sain and Kent were being forced back , but they were taking their toll on the steady stream of men .  They stepped back and panted harshly .  Their weapons were blood soaked and they were tired .  They had been hard at this combat for nearly five hours now .  The sun had risen quite high , and it was starting to give them a rather large blind spot .  But they heard the roar . \
Somewhere between a Dragon and a Pegasus does a Pegavern exist .  He result of a desperate female wyvern needing a clutch and a willing Pegasus stallion , these beasts are born .  Capable of complete flight and highly resistant to everything except arrows and good steel or silver weapons and sheer frost , these beasts are doomed to death in Bernian lands because of the harsh winters .  But this one had lived .  The beast swooped down towards the two knights who stared at it in a sense of awe .  It roared its displeasure . \
Sain and Kent dashed backwards towards the fort , running for their lives .  At the door sat calm , and very collected Garnet .  Ariana was patting him on the shoulder .    "  That thing's going to eat us , you know .   "   The Half-dragon looked at her very drolly .  'Duh . '\
  "  Isn't it a fellow Wyvern ?  "   The calm young dragon shook his head .  'No , it's a Pegavern , for lack of a better name .  Result of a desperate wyvern and a willing stallion Pegasus .  Very nasty and very stupid , but very mean , and always hungry .  I suppose I should kill it . '\
Ariana nodded solemnly as Kent and Sain dashed by her and took cover .  Garnet lazily stood up and yawned as the beast landed In front of him and his mistress .  It hissed at the pair of its deniers .  Ariana shivered .    "  C-c-c-cold\'85  "   she turned pale , and ran into the fort .    "  It breathes the winter !  "  \
In fact , it did .  It inhaled deeply , and pushed forth its magic , the frosting winds running into the fort's walls , leaving a snow-like power on everything .  Garnet merely shook it off .  'Got anything better ?' It looked at him with an expression of boredom .  'You might want to cover your ears , guys\'85'\
Garnet stood up slowly , and craned his head .  Instead of hearing the hissing of breath , they heard a low growl .  The Pegavern glared at its new prey , who withstood its freezing breath .  The growl began to get deeper in tone , and Sain suddenly realized what was happening .    "  ROAR !  "   he yelled , and dived into the blood soaked hall , holding his ears tightly .  Kent grabbed Ariana , and pulled her towards the inner room as she started to hyperventilate .    "  Cold\'85 cold\'85 winter\'85  "   Kent winced as he placed his hands over her ears . \
Garnet's growl suddenly erupted into nothing less than an earsplitting roar .  And he hadn't even stretched his neck out yet .  Wyverns do have a breath weapon , of sorts , but instead of exhaling liquid flame or anything of the sort , they drew the air into their bodies , heating it up , this is where a wyvern's roar comes from .  Bones in the wyvern's neck rattle about as the air is inhaled , causing sound , that builds as the air intake becomes more powerful . \
This however , was somewhere between a wyvern's roar and a dragon's .  A dragon's roar had magical properties .  Apparently , Garnet's did too .  The ear-splitting sound rocked forth like a wave , slamming the Pegavern with force enough to burst its eardrums .  The men in the direct path behind the Pegavern screamed in pain as their ears began to bleed , and not a few lost some teeth from the sheer force of the vibration . \
The actual exhaling is a different story all-together .  Young dragons , often called drakes , are somewhere between stages of evolution .  Their wings allow flight , but they cannot breathe flame , though their roars are about as powerful as they will be as full grown dragons .  At a Wyvern's second year , its body temperature spikes , keeping the beast at a very comfortable hundred fifty degrees .  This of course , is hot .  Combine that with a Half-step of dragon blood , ( Thereby enhancing the temperature , AND speeding the development of dragon biology ) and you get a four hundred degree blast of hot air soaked with an accelerant .  This is what happened to the army in front of Garnet . \
The young Half-dragon exhaled quickly , feeling something inside his body empty , unlike when he had melted Glass .  He tasted something peculiarly sweet in his breath as he exhaled , and he felt the air from his mouth heat enormously .  Then he felt the flames erupt .  The air was hot , and already swathing the Pegavern's fur-like scales , and hitting the men behind , but when the liquid soaked the air about them\'85\
Lyn saw the signs of Garnet using his breath as she and Dorcas stopped their southward Advance to gawk at the freakish beast the bandits had released .  She saw a kind of white mist erupt from the young-dragon's head as he exhaled his breath .  Then she saw it happen .  The flame started at the young-dragon's mouth , but it then erupted across the field like a million Elfire spells at once .    "  Holy Horse Lords of the Sky\'85  "   The wave of heated air was already blackening the men behind the beast's axes and flesh , but when the accelerant hit them , it was like watching hell come onto earth .  The wide cone of soaked air blasted the men with the whitish liquid , and then it caught fire , each drop not burning , but exploding as though it were an entire tome of fire in one moment .  She could see the men go flying through the air , limbs blown off , a roasted flesh sloping wetly off of fire-scorched bones . \
Garnet stopped exhaling as he felt the accelerant empty from him .  He spat a little , and coughed .  'Whoa\'85 that was new . ' The smoke in front of him drifted away slowly , revealing the Pegavern .  Its fur was ablaze , and scales had been blown out of its flesh , and it had gaping holes where skin should have been .  It leaned down and roared its protest as it snapped at Garnet .  The smaller , more nimble beast dashed outside and flew , pulling the fight into the air .  The twin dragons danced in the air , the slower bigger Pegavern was having trouble keeping up , seeing as holes had been blown in its wings . \
Garnet snarled as he dodged another bite .  He swooped around , somehow getting around the Pegavern's neck .  His fangs still dripped with the accelerant .  The liquid poured into the beast's bloodstream .  And wyvern breath is hot , causing the normally cold bodied creature to begin to heat up .  Garnet locked his claws into a bare spot on the Pegavern's back .  He didn't let go for quite a time .  The flight of this beast was doomed .  Garnet ripped his teeth away , pulling quite a bit of flesh with it .  Accelerant soaked blood poured out of the beast and onto the men down below who were preparing for another assault .  But Garnet didn't release the beast just yet .  He reached back with his neck , and bit into the Pegavern's more fragile wing .  He ripped it away calmly .  He released his hold on the Pegavern , and smirked .  The beast fell away , out of the sky , and landed on two very frightened men . \
Lyn and Dorcas ran for the fort .  She ducked inside the main room and screamed   "  DOWN ! EVERYONE GET DOWN !  "  \
Garnet landed in front of the two men , and smiled , biting into the Pegavern's exposed stomach as it breathed its last .  'Hello , Gentlemen .  My name is Garnet .  I am a very evil wyvern , with a very evil agenda .  You see , your men hurt the man my mistress seems to like .  This is bad .  This is very bad .  For you . ' He smiled quietly and pushed the flesh underneath the two men's heads .  Garnet looked at the body of the Pegavern , and he already felt his accelerant gland begin to refill .  Of course , it was nowhere near full , but it was enough .  He calmly stepped around to the front of the dying beast , which tried to roar at him .  He waited until the jaws opened , then snapped , using his tongue to hold the beast's throat open as he shot a stream of accelerant down it's gullet .  He jerked quickly , hearing a satisfying snap , and he knew he had broken the beast's neck , so that it couldn't vomit .  He quickly released his grip , and let its jaw snap shut .  He calmly stalked around to the front of the two men again , and spat a bit of accelerant in a strip along the ground . \
They looked at the dragon with pure fear in their eyes .  His slightly golden-scarlet tinted scales shimmered in the mid-morning light .  He blew a stream of hot air at the accelerant , which started to burn slowly .  'I wonder what happens when this flame reaches that piece of meat under your heads , that's filled with my venom . ' He smiled .  'I would love to stay and find out , but I'm afraid my Mistress may need me .  Cheerio , Gents ! Have a fine day , and I wish you well in the rest of your life !' Garnet walked away and flapped his wings , getting altitude as the rest of the men under the service of Carjiga gathered around to see what happened to their leader .  Garnet smiled , and landed in the main place , before snuggling up to Ariana .  The rest of them looked at garnet with raised eyebrows .  'I believe you like big blazing fires , my queen ?'\
Ariana giggled .    "  Oh yes , Sir Wyvern , I love fire !  "   She snuggled into garnet's fading fur .  He walked towards the main entrance to the fort .  He looked back over his shoulders .  'I suggest you take cover . ' He said simply . \
Carjiga sighed as his assistant kept trying to blow the flame out .  It only succeeded in accelerating it .    "  I didn't want to die today\'85  "  \
The explosion rocked the nearby countryside for a full forty seconds .  The first explosions they heard were small and in short bursts .  They were explosions nonetheless , though most knew not what they were .  Of course , once the flames and explosions had reached to the stomach\'85\
Garnet himself was surprised at the force of the blast .  Ariana simply whooped .  The corpse of the Pegavern suddenly became a fine red mist in about a second , and then he saw the enormous fireball reaching into the sky like a protest of the very earth .  The men who had been soaked in the liquid were blown back , and exploded in the heated air , turning into red colored showers in mid air .  It looked almost like the Ilian 'Fireworks' Ariana was so interested in .  Two scorched skulls landed in front of him .  'Huh\'85 Looks like their heads got blown off first .  Oh well . ' Ariana whooped and hollered as she watched the massive fireball rise into the sky . \
\
I smiled as I lay their peacefully , watching the world through garnet's eyes .  I looked back over my shoulder .    "  I thank you Elimine , for granting Garnet that power .   "   She smiled .    "  I granted nothing .  That power is from within him .  That is his birth-right .  I protected your army for you while you were wounded .  A Cleric will be along soon , I hope .  We need you fighting fit .   "   She patted me on the shoulder . \
\
I shrugged .    "  I suppose it wasn't a bad trade .  I wouldn't have seen something like this in my old life .  A nuclear explosion , in this world ? That's just a bit extraordinary .   "   I smiled . \
Elimine grinned .    "  When your world is extraordinary in and of it's self , you tend to take the unexpected for granted .   "  \
I smiled , and lay back down with my body , rather enjoying the down-time . \
\
Erk was the first to get up .    "  DAMN ! What in Elimine's great name was that !  "  \
\
Serra shrugged , and stood up , running towards the massive fireball rising into the sky .    "  Well , all I know is I want to find out !  "  \
Erk sighed .    "  Wait up , Serra !  "   he dashed after the hyperactive priestess . \
\
Well , there we go , another installment of my story .  Hope you all liked it !\
\
Tune in next time !\
Explanations for this chapter : Hiiro was an OC submitted by Razorangel that seemed to strike my interest .  Then again , he seems very\'85 Spike Spiegel like and I like Spike .  What can I say ? Shrug\
Garnet's breath ? Simple .  As a base for being a dragon , I'm mixing two different dragon types .  In Reign of Fire , the dragons breathe fire by mixing an Accelerant and a Catalyst , there by making the air burn , thus breathing fire .  In a wyvern , which are basically winged komodo dragons , the teeth are coated in bacteria after a certain age , insuring that the Komodo gets a kill if it gets a bite .  Therefore , Garnet , being only half dragon , would only get one part of the dragon system , and one part of the wyvern system .  The dragon part I choose is the accelerant .  And being warm blooded , they would have warm breath , but , being as big as they are , to keep the skin correctly heated , they would need a MASSIVE internal body temperature .  His fangs are coated in the accelerant with every breath , no matter how insignificant , insuring that he can breathe fire when he needs to , or just make things explode when he bites them . \
Thus : Garnet breathes out little white specks that are flammable , and explosive if in concentrations .  Somewhat like gasoline .  Garnet's heated breath hits these specks .  It's enough to melt Glass' sword , so it's enough to make these things go boom .  TADA ! Explosive breathing wyvern !\
 .  There , happy now all you unbelievers ?\
Since my last chapter got cut a bit shorter than I would have liked ( Hell , the tactician was beat into a holy shit hole by his Sister/Commander/Charge-as-a-guardian-angel ) I'm going to feature a new support chapter this time .  I know , it wasn't announced , but I really need Kai at full strength . \
And by the way , RazorAngel , thank you so much for the positive reviews .  Thank you all for the reviews .  If it wasn't for Razor's spike Spiegel look-a-like and his incessant reviewing , I might not pump these out at least every 2 days .  I'm one of those writers who thrive on reviewer strength .  I'm glad you liked Garnet's breath .  I was going for something between a black dragon ( Known for corrosive breath and acidic bites , very Komodo-dragonish , if you ask me .  ) and a Gold Dragon .  ( Known for flaming breath .  )\
Ah , but I'm wasting time , this isn't a rant chapter . \
Or is it ? MWHAHAHA !  . \
\
Support chapter 2 : Burned Earth Policy ?\
\
\
The campfire was bright as Serra and Erk came ever closer to whatever it was that was calling to Serra .  Somehow , she knew she couldn't arrive to early\'85 but she might be too late . \
\
Garnet coughed up another blood soaked ball .  He looked at it with distaste , and flung it into the pit he was making for them .  Ariana sat beside her best friend .    "  What are those anyway , Garnet ?  "  \
'As far as I can tell\'85' the dragon began to muse with a worried tone , 'what's left of my stomach's lining .  Wyvern bodies weren't meant to cope with the accelerant I shoot out to make my fireworks . ' He gagged again harshly .  'We heal fast , but I still won't be breathing fire , or even that liquid for quite a while .  I went a little\'85 happy with that . '\
She smirked .    "  Kinda like my first fire spells .  My fingers still hurt from those .   "   She wasn't wounded nearly anywhere on the scale of Kai , but her fingers did hurt .  She had cast the spell nearly one hundred times in a row , just for practice . \
'When did you learn that ?' Garnet asked inquisitively . \
  "  Kai taught me while you were locked up for being a naughty dragon .   "  \
Garnet sighed physically as he spat out another stream of bloodied chunks .  'All in the interest of science my dear\'85 Go talk to Sain for a while ; I'm fairly sure he and Hiiro are up to no good . '\
She shrugged and nodded .  She understood the meaning of   "  Leave me to my misery .   "   When it came from her wyvern-dragon , it meant he was sore .  She skipped towards the fort .  Garnet hawked another blood soaked chunk of flesh up and groaned .  He looked at the small crater he stood over , now nearly half full of blood and guts and corpses .  'By the way , Ariana\'85' he thought just before she was out of mind-shot , 'Sain's not packing more than me . ' He smirked as he heard her eep and he felt the small clod of dirt smack his wing . \
  "  PERVERTED DRAGON !  "   Garnet shrugged .  'At least I'm the lucky one .  The hottest woman in the group claims me\'85 even if I have to share . '\
Sain smiled quietly .    "  Heya demon .   "   He heard Ariana say .  Hiiro took the advantage .  With a quick sweep , the guy had Sain in a Bear-hug of sorts .    "  Hiya , Angel !  "   Sain replied nonchalantly as the Mercenary took him down to the ground .  Sain rolled over with the tight squeeze from the slightly shorter man , and smirked as he sat on top of him .  Kent looked at Hiiro with a look of pity .    "  Fire in the Hole !  "   Sain yelled . \
Hiiro was dancing around and screaming in utter pain quickly .    "  OH GOD ! I'M BLIND ! AUGH !  "  \
Kent shook his head .    "  Never squeeze Sain too hard .  He's able to release on demand .  We call it his   "  Super weapon  "   of sorts .  Somewhat like a Durandal .  Only stronger .   "   The red pants knight nodded calmly . \
  "  WHAT THE HELL MAN ? UGH !  "   Hiiro tried to sneeze , but releasing his nose only brought air into the poor nostrils , which still had the scent clinging to the hairs .  Of course , this fed him a whiff of what could be nothing less than exactly what hell smelled like . \
Sain of course , sat calmly in the middle of the slightly tinted air .    "  I honestly don't see what the problem is .   "   He inhaled deeply .    "  It just smells normal to me .   "  \
Kent smirked .    "  That's because you live with it .  Besides , that weapon could convince even the Daein Marquess to cease and desist .   "   Kent of course , was sitting calmly by , waiting the stink out .    "  By the way , Hiiro , as a general rule , the stench lasts for about three minutes .  He's part of the Hazing rituals now .  For three days and nights , he has to eat nothing but Lima , Butter , Pinto , Chili , Great northern , hell , any bean they can get\'85  "   He smirked as Hiiro looked at him with fear .    "  And they stick him in a nicely made shack .  Air tight .  And he lets one off .   "  \
  "  Really , those are prize winners .  One season , I had a 3 minute long constant foghorn .   "   He smirked .    "  The air really was slightly green in that cabin\'85 And lord was it painful to watch those cadets go in .   "   He smiled brightly .    "  After about thirty seconds I noticed the air going green .  About a minute later , I smelled the most awful stench of all time .  But , it was for the kids .   "  \
Hiiro could finally breathe again .    "  How long do they have to stay in there ?  "  \
  "  From breakfast mess hall's end , at seven 15 sharp , till Lunch mess hall's beginning .  Lunch mess begins at roughly 11 :15 .  Four hours in all .   "  \
Hiiro's jaw hit the ground .    "  How many make it through\'85  "  \
  "  All of them , we don't let them Out .   "   Said Sain with a smirk .  Kent nodded solemnly .    "  After they walk in they begin to doubt they're Caelin Knight Material .  They stay completely silent and breathe as slow as possible .  Still , it's a horrible experience .   "  \
  "  What other kind of hazing do you guys do ?  "  \
  "  Well , I do take part in it occasionally .  I scare off more than Sain's weapon , but that's because they're free to flee at that point .  Usually , there are four weeks of hazing .  And in the fourth week , they face his weapon .  It's the last hazing point .  If they can walk inside without hurling , they're in .  If they can survive all four Hours\'85 We respect them .  We've pulled out guys who've passed out , guys who've shit themselves\'85it's horrible .   "  \
Kent shrugged .    "  As for what I do , I usually get the first week Knights .  I make them strip to their skivvies in pitch black , and then get a flame lit .  I dress like a Savage and do some Kata .  If they flinch , they're out .   "  \
Hiiro raised his eyebrow .    "  But they're already Knights\'85 .  Aren't they going to be allowed to stay in the corps ?  "   Kent smirked .    "  Well , you see , in Caelin , there is a stipulation in the Knight's Code .  It states that any who fail 'Peer Muster' will be demoted to squire of the peer who they could not pass .  Meaning , if I scare you , you're my Squire for a week , and then I put you right back in for the hazing , this time putting you back into squire hazing .   "  \
Hiiro's eyebrow rose even further , threatening to eat his forehead .    "  Squire hazing ?  "   Sain smiled .    "  In Caelin , Squire hazing is simple .  You go out , and you find a brigand .  You kill him , and you bring his body back .  A Knight will accompany you , but he cannot aid you unless you're near death .   "  \
Hiiro could breathe now .    "  Alright , but we agreed this little match was to be free of weapons .  That\'85 That gateway to hell you call an anus is off limits too .   "   Sain nodded and stood up , walking a bit over towards the woods .    "  I might be a bit then\'85  "  \
Florina had watched the whole thing .  She sighed .  Sain was an odd one .  She was a full thirty foot clear of the cloud ( Which was consequently drifting towards the place where they had camped Kai out .  He was too wounded to move .  ) She gasped as she heard a sound something akin to a carriage's breaks squealing in protest to going down a hill quickly .  She then heard Sain's voice .    "  Sorry !  "  \
Kent was the one who replied as he stood , ready to wrestle with Hiiro .    "  Just finish your business boy and keep silent !  "  \
  "  Kent !  "   Sain yelled from behind the tree ,   "  If I were to keep them silent , you and I both know I'd have to move away every thirty seconds .   "  \
Hiiro and Florina both paled .  Lyn just rolled her eyes , and Ariana couldn't stifle the fits of laughter .  She finally sat down with Lyndis to watch Kai .    "  Well , at least we know how to avoid smelling it\'85  "  \
  "  Too much perfume is never enough .   "   They nodded sagely as they heard Hiiro take a rather painful fall .  Florina continued to referee the match .  Kent she was very comfortable around .  Sain too , but Hiiro was still too new .  Dorcas was just Dorcas .  He was off taking Natalie back to the village . \
Kai started to stir\'85\
  "  He's waking up !  "   Lyn hollered\'85 then she nearly jumped out of her seat as he started to nearly seizure .    "  STINKS !  "   and he passed out . \
\
I coughed and gagged wildly in my ether state , while Elimine and Roland laughed at me as if I were a clown .    "  OH ELIMINE BE DAMNED THAT WAS\'85 .  OH GODDESS SAVE ME !  "  \
\
Roland snickered .    "  He's an accomplished hazer , that's for sure\'85  "  \
Elimine smirked as I rolled around nearly seizing .    "  Well , you thought you were ready to go back to your body .  Wait on those two I said were coming .   "  \
  "  You are a cold hearted-bitch !  "   I screamed at her and I stormed off , sneezing furiously in an effort to expunge the stink tainted snot from my nose .  Sain had always been far away from me when he blasted one .  But still , I had smelled some of them before .  That weapon was as powerful to the soul as garnet's breath was to the body .    "  Demoralize a whole damn army with one fart , I swear !  "  \
Roland and Elimine smiled as they watched the disembodied strategist walk away from his corpse in the vaguely blue and grey version of earth that they had crafted for him while he was 'dead' so to speak .  Roland looked over at Elimine .    "  You know he's right though .   "  \
  "  About what ?  "  \
Roland refrained from saying the first thing that was in his mouth .  He swallowed the comment .    "  The demoralization part .  Why in the world would you give someone a fart that stinks THAT badly ?  "  \
  "  I work in mysterious ways my dear Roland .   "  \
\
Sain snuck the small book out of his waist-pouch and began to read as he took care of business .  The title ?   "  Self-confidence : How to get the shy girl .   "  \
\
Kent and Hiiro laid back and panted from their last round .  They had gone hold for hold .  Florina just absently stared at Hiiro's lower abdomen , willing her eyes not to drift even further down .  She was already hot and bothered .  Hiiro was cute as all hell and had that   "  I'm badass .  Fear me .   "   Air too him , kind of like Sain , only\'85 meaner .  But kinder at the same time .  He was also hot and covered in sweat .  And panting .  She couldn't even try to save her mind as it took off down gutter lane .  A little blob of drool formed at the corner of her mouth . \
\
Wil sat shotgun to Dorcas as the horses pulled the cart back to camp .    "  Well well , it seems the group has been having\'85 .  GODS ALIVE ! WHAT IS THAT FOUL SMELL !  "  \
\
Garnet , despite being alone in his misery ( Though he almost felt healthy ) was the first to respond .  'Well , Sain farted .  And then he went and used the bathroom . '\
  "  Which is still presently occupied !  "   yelled the man from behind a tree .  Dorcas just grunted .    "  When you've gotta go\'85  "  \
  "  Well why couldn't he go in the crater ?  "  \
'I wouldn't have it .  I'm miserable enough , without my much more sensitive nose smelling that .  Trust me ; it's strong enough over here .  Burning human flesh is not pleasant , and this whole place stinks of Pegavern !'\
  "  Maybe I shouldn't have bought the preserved beans-and-beef-lengths\'85 Bad Idea , Dorcas .   "  \
Wil paled .    "  Those are not to come ANYWHERE near Sain .  At all .  At any time .  Ever .  In the history of history !  "   Dorcas just smiled . \
  "  Sain ! I brought a local specialty for you ! We call them affectionately ,   "  Beanie-weenies .   "   I want you to try some !  "  \
  "  Sounds delicious !  "  \
Sain was getting up , and walking to the river , WELL down stream of where they got their drinking water from , and a bit downstream of the clothes washing area . \
Dorcas grinned widely as he got the mess items from the covered wagon .  Wil helped as well .    "  Ah , so Dorcas is cooking again ?  "   asked Hiiro as he sat around the fire .    "  Yeah , Antelious stew with chili beans .   "   He grabbed the small pail of milk and poured a bit in the pot with the tomato sauce and water and beef .  He began to dice up carrots and onions .  Lyn helped by peeling the potatoes . \
Garnet slowly trudged around and sat beside Ariana , and left the space beside him empty .  'Not so spicy , eh , Dorcas ?'\
  "  That's kind of funny .   "   He said as he dusted off the onion shavings from his apron .  He walked back to the wagon .    "  Who wants hard tack ?  "   Not a single hand went up .  He smirked .    "  Good , I would have kicked your asses .  We're having biscuits ! Natalie would have my nuts in a vice if I ever cooked hard tack\'85  "   he shuddered as he remembered that night\'85\
\
It was stormy , and dreary , but the cabin was cozy .  They were running low on food again , so they decided on Tack-and-mustard .  It was a staple food of the poor .  If you couldn't afford real biscuits or jelly , you had tack-and-mustard .  The only problem was that Dorcas , for all of his culinary talent , ( His family was a long line of chefs .  ) he couldn't cook hard tack .  It escaped him . \
\
Natalie was hungry though , so he would DEFFIENTALY give it a shot .  He pulled out the flour and poured a bit of water to it .  He put it in the pan on the stove .  Four minutes later\'85\
  "  DISGUSTING !  "   Natalie yelled as she uppercutted her husband ( Thereby sending him flying .  )   "  I'm supposed to eat this pig-shit ?  "   another blow and the helpless Dorcas was apologizing .    "  I married you because you're nice and you can cook\'85 And you try to feed me this utter shit ?  "  \
\
Dorcas shook off the night mare .    "  Let's just say I can't cook tack , hard or soft .   "  \
\
Everyone had seen the look of fear in his eyes .  Sain took his seat and nodded .    "  Rough woman then ?  "  \
  "  You have no Idea .   "  \
  "  I might .   "  \
They heard some ruffling .    "  Hello the camp !  "  \
Sain got up with garnet and Ariana .    "  Drop your weapons where you stand .  Books and staves too .   "  \
The two obeyed as the fading light of day caught them in dusty robes .  A cleric and a mage they looked like .    "  Mage , remove your cloak , Cleric , on your Honor as a servant of Elimine , swear you have no blade .   "  \
She nodded .    "  Why in the world would I carry a blade ? I have my Erky-poo to protect me !  "  \
The girls in the camp looked like they had just been tail-slapped by their dragon , and the guys just had one single thought .    "  Hige ?  "  \
  "  I am NOT your 'Erky-poo' whatever that means .  GOD you need to watch your tongue .   "  \
  "  Goddess , you sacrilegious bastard ! And watch how you talk to me , I AM after all , a cleric of house Ostia !  "  \
The group sighed .    "  Gather your belongings and drop them at the dragon's feet , then follow Ariana into camp .  We'll feed and shelter you , so long as you mind the wounded .   "   Lyn finished speaking and looked a Hiiro .  He nodded quietly .  If they needed something watched\'85 quietly\'85 they turned to him . \
  "  My name is Erk .   "   He sat down on the log he was lead too .    "  I am Serra\'85 Oh my Goddess' light ! BRING ME MY STAFF DRAGON !  "  \
Serra's eyes had fallen on the pale skinned youth in the middle of the circle .  The others went for their weapons as garnet brought the staff .  He dropped it , and she was certain she thought a male voice said to her 'Here .  Take it . '\
As she stood and lifted her staff , she was stopped by Erk's hand .  Lyn spoke his silent concern .    "  Harm our Strategist\'85 and you'll be gutted and fed to our dragon .   "   As if to emphasize the point , Garnet growled and licked his lips . \
  "  Oh shut up girl .  I'm a cleric ; it's my job to assist the needy .   "   Lyn's only thought on that was 'Cheeky little bitch\'85'\
  "  Great Elimine , Bless this man with all your strength ! Bring him from death's door , and deliver him unto us ! Let him breathe and walk again , and reside amongst the living !  "  \
Lyn shook her head .    "  Stupid girl\'85 He's a Strategist .  You must do something for me or swear loyalty to be able to heal him .  I'm his Cipher .   "  \
Erk sighed .    "  Well then , swear off to her Serra .   "  \
Serra giggled as she blushed .    "  I was just trying to heal him as soon as possible .  I swear to you , Lady of this camp , that I will heal your comrade and nothing more .   "  \
Lyn nodded , and suddenly , Serra ( And Erk , for some reason ) felt a weight tie onto them .    "  What's this ?  "  \
Hiiro sighed .    "  He's dying .  We all feel it .  He's an angel , of sorts .  His presence raises us up , and gives us strength .  Lyn is feeling more\'85 hospitable to him , worried for him .  That makes her a better Cipher , or something .  Ask Kent for the details , just heal him .   "  \
Kent sighed .    "  My father designed some Strategist amulets .  His is a Derivative .  Instead of requiring blood directly , it requires FAITH and blood .  And trust .  It enables quicker spells and blessings from the strategist , but it carries a much heavier price to use .  It's a double edged sword .   "  \
Serra nodded as she slammed the staff down to invoke it , and she pared silently .  The wounds on the man began to heal .  Kent continued .    "  This also links him more closely to the army .  Basically , he feels every hit we take , roughly .  But we feel just how hurt he is .  Without us , he would be dead .  We NEED him , and so we hold his soul close to his body .   "  \
They all felt something tighten .  Kent screamed   "  STOP !  "   Serra did so under a look of protest .    "  Why ?  "  \
  "  You're scorching him .   "  \
\
I nearly screamed as my hand got burned .  Elimine was by my side in a moment .    "  Mana burn\'85  "   she said quietly .    "  I'm sorry Kai , I didn't know she was\'85 well , that stupid .   "  \
\
I held my hand as the black scorch marks traveled up my hand and I screamed in pain .    "  STOP YOU STUPID WITCH !  "   I wanted to strike her .  But Kent saved me .  I could hear him explain . \
  "  Strategists are a different breed .  You could heal a warrior like that , or even a mage , but with him , it has to be slower , more deliberate .  As you know , most weapons have residual enchantments , and magic is an enchantment .  Being a Strategist takes a very special person .  They must be able to 'Phase' .  When they're phased , their bodies empty of their souls but leave a tie to their bodies .  Then they link to our souls , effectively 'Haunting' us .  That's how the command so naturally .  But ANY attack can be EXTRMELY lethal , armor or no .  Armor usually worsens it .   "  \
  "  You see , their souls are so closely linked to this world , even friendly magic can harm them .  It's called   "  Mana burn .   "   And it's the most lethal thing in the world .   "  \
Serra shook her head .    "  I've never heard tell of this\'85  "  \
Kent sighed .    "  Ostia is commanded by its generals , correct ? Well , the other cantons employ   "  tacticians .   "   A tactician is a Strategist who is less connected to the world .   "   He continued his explanation .    "  They don't receive Mana burn on their souls .  They receive it on their bodies .  That's the key difference .  If they are attacked , they receive a black scorch mark around the wound\'85 such as Kai's shoulder .   "  \
He sighed .    "  Try again , but go VERY slowly .  If the wounds can be clearly seen healing , you're scorching him .   "  \
She nodded , and I gulped .  My life , my very EXISTANCE was in the hands of a newbie cleric .  She nodded and began to pray , and I felt the mana burn slowly spread .    "  SLOWER !  "   Kent shouted .  He watched my shoulder intently .  The knitting flesh was painstakingly slow and I could see sweat beading on Serra's forehead .  I felt the mana burn on my shoulder begin to recede .  Elimine patted me .    "  She's doing much better .   "  \
I nodded , and grunted when she forced me into my body .    "  Go back , Kai , your journey is still not done .   "  \
\
I gasped .    "  ELIMINE !  "   Lyn and the others nearly swarmed me .    "  Ugh\'85 Never heal me that fast again , Serra .   "  \
\
She nodded and sat down panting .  Dorcas just served up the bowls of stew .    "  It's good to be back guys\'85 but I'm fucking HUNGRY ! Let's eat !  "  \
Lyn smirked and elbowed Kent .    "  He's back .   "  \
Hiiro was next .    "  The leper speaks ! How was heaven ?  "  \
  "  Blue , grey , and it looks a lot like this place\'85 then again , I was being held in limbo because you guys needed me .   "   I shrugged .    "  Fix me up a bowl of that , Dorcas !  "  \
\
The black cloaked strategist hissed from the shadows and looked at the remaining Ganeleon bandits .    "  We can't attack them right now\'85  "   One of them snarled .  Bug stayed silent .    "  We have to ! They're wounded and the cleric's spent !  "  \
\
The man suddenly found his jaw simply missing .  The Black cloaked man's eyes slit tighter as he crushed the offending appendage between his fingers .  The man tried to scream , but he found something else in his throat .  The black-cloaked man's hand was in his throat , ripping out his wind-pipe .  Bug looked away .    "  Stupid\'85 never question a Black Fang strategist .  We lost Carjiga because he didn't listen .   "  \
The strategist began to rip the man apart , watching the man's eyes as he did so .  The man tried to fight but found he couldn't move his arm .  He looked down in time to see the dragon-like claws rip into his shoulder and remove a muscle .  He felt the beast's other hand rip at a rib . \
Bug looked at the sickly yellow blood in the Blood-bind .  The Strategist was in a 'Blood lust' that the Black-fang woman had warned him of .  He looked at his second .    "  Bring me a bird .  We got some Defective merchandise .   "   He took off the amulet , and the freak who was tearing apart the man beside him barely noticed . \
  "  I can't feel that exquisite pain anymore ! Did you have a change of heart ?  "   he pulled the still beating object from the man's now shredded chest .  The man was finally dying .  He squeezed it and smiled at the shower of blood . \
Bug dropped his axe on the neck of the morph .    "  Poor guy\'85 You guys understand now ? This\'85 merchandise is very buggy .  The girl said it's a two sided sword .  We're moving on , we'll ambush these guys from the next villages .   "  \
The men nodded , and looked at the twitching mass on top of the now chestless man .  Bug continued to butcher it , until it stopped twitching , but the head still watched it with fascination .    "  HURT ME MORE !  "   it yelled as Bug turned .  Bug looked back at it\'85 then split it like a melon .    "  Fine .   "   He said as they started walking towards the Lycian nation . \
\
Well , that's that .  Seems the Morphs ( Being soulless ) Eventually go batty if they use blessings , or even try to be strategists .  ( Namely because a being without a soul would Psionically project , and that taxes the mind .  Being beasts made of just random soul energy , they're not even stable normally !\
\
I apologize for slipping in a new chapter like this .  I like the idea of support chapters though .  They just seem to fill the voids between chapters .  I may make them a regular feature .  shrug Dunno , though it would be very nice to have something horrible happen every chapter then find a way to fix it in the SCs .  Or vise versa .  shrug Oh well . \
Next chapter : Mission 5 : ( I'll get the name in a minute .  ) : A half-dragon takes to the sky , and blood of his mistress is shared .  But when the last of the Ganeleon bandits decide to attack , what is it become of the Strategist and his crew ?\
P . S .  I'll give you a hint .  I've decided to begin the over-arcing Subplot ( Which will span on into the FE8 fic that's going to be written after this one .  ) Think back a few chapters , before the nuke breath but after the Mani-Katti .  Read that chapter again .  You'll figure it out . \
P . S . S .  What creature in FE 8 looks a lot like a half-dragon ? TRIVA FOR THE WIN PUNKAHS !  . \
Bounce time for me , catch ya on the flipside ! ( I know , I fail miserably at being gangsta , G .  )
